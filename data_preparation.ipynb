       "['\\n \\n15 RISK FACTORS  \\nProspective Noteholders should consider, among other things, the following factors in connection with the \\npurchase of the Notes.  \\n',\n",
       " '  \\nGeneral market and credit risk . \\nDebt instruments are subject to credit and interest rate risks . Credit risk refers to the likelihood that an obligor \\nwill default in the payment of principal or interest on an instrument. Financial strength and solvency of an obligor are \\nthe primary factors influencing credit risk. In addition, lack or inadequacy of collateral or credit enhancement for a \\ndebt instrument may affect its credit risk. Credit risk may change over the life of an instrument and debt instruments that are rated by rating agencies are often reviewed and may be subject to downgrade.  Interest rate risk refers to the \\nrisks associated with market changes in interest rates. Interest rate changes may affect the value of a debt instrument \\nindirectly (especially in the case of fixed rate obligations) or directly (especially in the case of instruments w hose rates \\nare adjustable). In general, rising interest rates will negatively impact the price of a fixed rate debt instrument and falling interest rates will have a positive effect on price, while the income from such instrument will remain fixed. \\nConvers ely, income generated by floating rate debt instruments will generally rise and fall as interest rates rise and \\nfall, but the price of such asset will usually not vary due to changes in interest rates.  \\nGeneral economic conditions . \\nSignificant risks may exi st for the Issuer and investors in the Notes as a result of uncertain general economic \\nconditions. These risks include, among others, (i) the possibility that the prices at which Portfolio Assets can be sold \\nby the Issuer will have deteriorated from their effective purchase price, (ii) the illiquidity of the Notes, as there may \\nbe no secondary trading in the Notes and (iii) the possibility of a decline in the market value of the Notes. These risks may affect the returns on the Notes to investors and the abi lity of investors to realize their investment in the Notes \\nprior to the Stated Maturity Date, if at all. This may increase reinvestment or refinancing risk in respect of maturing \\nPortfolio Assets. These additional risks may affect the returns on the Notes to investors and could further slow, delay \\nor reverse an economic recovery and cause a further deterioration in performance of the Portfolio Assets generally. Limitations on the amount of available credit in the market may have an adverse impact on general  economic \\nconditions that affect the performance of the Portfolio Assets. The slowdown in growth or commencement of a recession would be expected to have an adverse effect on the ability of businesses to repay or refinance their existing debt. Adverse macr oeconomic conditions may adversely affect the rating, performance and the realization value of \\nthe Portfolio Assets. It is possible that the Portfolio Assets will experience higher default rates than anticipated and that performance will suffer.  \\nThe market  value and performance of the Portfolio Assets and the Notes may be adversely impacted by \\ncurrent and future economic conditions, including perceptions of potential, current or future conditions, market trading imbalances or technical dislocation. To the e xtent that economic and business conditions deteriorate, the levels of \\ndefaults and delinquencies are likely to increase and market values may decrease or not fully recover, which may \\nadversely affect the amount of sale proceeds that could be obtained upon the sale of the Portfolio Assets and could \\nadversely impact the ability of the Issuer to make payments on the Notes.  \\nThe bankruptcy or insolvency of a major financial institution may have an adverse effect on the Issuer, \\nparticularly if such financial ins titution is the administrative agent of one or more of the Portfolio Assets. In addition, \\nthe bankruptcy, insolvency or financial distress of one or more additional financial institutions, or one or more sovereigns, may trigger additional crises in the glo bal credit markets and overall economy which could have a \\nsignificant adverse effect on the Portfolio Assets, and consequently on the Issuer and the Notes.  \\nCOVID -19 Outbreak has caused economic distress and uncertainty.  \\n There has been a widespread outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a new coronavirus (named COVID -\\n19) that was first detected in China in December 2019 and spread to many countries globally, including the United \\nStates (the “ COVID- 19 Outbreak ”). The COVID -19 Outbreak has been declared a pandemic by the World Health \\n \\n16 Organization, and on March 13, 2020, the president of the United States declared a national emergency.  The COVID -\\n19 Outbreak has led (and may continue to lead) to a s ignificant economic disruption globally, as well as in the economy \\nof the United States and the economies of other nations where the coronavirus disease has arisen. The U.S. federal, \\nstate and local governments initially  adopted a number of emergency measures and recommendations in response to \\nthe COVID- 19 Outbreak, which have included “ shelter in place ” restrictions, curfews, banning large gatherings and \\nclosing non -essential businesses, including, but not limited to bars, restaurants, movie theatres and gyms.  While \\ncertain jurisdictions have begun to ease some of these restrictions, t he nature of these emergency measures and \\nrestrictions vary in different areas of the United States depending on the severity of the localized outbreak and other \\nfactors.  As  a result of the pandemic and the governments ’ responses, many businesses have temporarily suspended \\nor limited operations and laid -off or furloughed employees  and may continue to do so. Additional governmental \\nactions may be forthcoming with additional ne gative economic effects.  The COVID -19 Outbreak and the various \\ngovernments ’ response s have  caused substantial disruption, volatility and a reduction in liquidity in the capital markets \\nand the credit markets .  While markets stabilized and general economic growth in the United States recovered to an \\nextent after the initial outbreak, subsequent developments, including the Omicron variant and any other variants of the coronavirus, and their effects may cause market conditions to remain uncertain, and a perio d of deterioration and \\nvolatility could reemerge in certain sectors of the economy or broadly .  Any such volatility, as well as the generally \\nnegative economic impact, may have adverse impacts on the Portfolio Assets and the Notes.  \\nIlliquidity in the fixe d income markets may affect the Portfolio Assets . \\nThe financial markets have experienced and may, in the future, experience substantial fluctuations in prices \\nfor fixed income securities and limited liquidity for such instruments. During periods of limited liquidity and higher \\nprice volatility, the Issuer ’s ability to dispose of Portfolio Assets (for which there is limited liquidity even in favorable \\nmarket conditions) at a price and time that the Collateral Manager deems advantageous may be severely impair ed. \\nSuch inability may impair the Issuer ’s ability to dispose of investments in a timely fashion and for a fair price.  \\nThe financial crisis and the leveraged finance markets . \\nAmong the sectors of the global credit markets that have experienced particular difficulty during the financial \\ncrisis of 2008 –  2010 were the collateralized debt obligations and leveraged finance markets. There continue to exist \\nsignificant risks for the Issuer and investors should economic conditions deteriorate again, including as a result of \\ngeopolitical disruptions such as the Russian/Ukrainian conflict of 2022. These risks include, among others, (i) the \\nlikelihood that the Issuer will find it more difficult to sell any of its assets in the secondary market, thus rendering it more  difficult to dispose of such assets, (ii) the possibility that, on or after the Closing Date, the price at which assets \\ncan be sold by the Issuer will have deteriorated from their effective purchase price and (iii) the illiquidity of the Notes, \\nas there i s currently little or no secondary trading in securities issued in connection with collateral debt obligation \\ntransactions. These risks may affect the returns on the Notes to investors and the ability of investors to realize their \\ninvestment in the Notes p rior to their stated maturity, if at all.  In addition, obligors on Portfolio Assets may be more \\nlikely to exercise any rights they may have to redeem or refinance such Portfolio Assets when interest rates or spreads are declining. These additional risks m ay affect the returns on the Notes to investors.  A slowdown in growth or \\ncommencement of a recession in the global economy, including as a result of inflationary pressures and resulting \\ninterest rate hikes,  will have an adverse effect on the ability of co nsumers and businesses to repay or refinance their \\nexisting debt. Adverse macroeconomic conditions may adversely affect the rating, performance and the realization \\nvalue of the Portfolio Assets. It is possible that the Portfolio Assets will experience high er default rates than anticipated \\nand that performance will suffer. During the financial crisis, some leading global financial institutions were forced \\ninto mergers with other financial institutions, were partially or fully nationalized or became bankrupt or insolvent.   \\nThere can be no assurance that similar drastic measures will not be taken as a result of future disruptions in the global \\ncredit markets.  \\nLegal, Regulatory and Other Risks Relating to the Offering \\nInvestment Company Act . \\nThe Co -Issuers have not registered and do not expect to register, and the pool of Portfolio Assets has not \\nbeen registered and is not expected to be registered, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “ SEC ”) \\nas investment companie s pursuant to the Investment Company Act in reliance on an exception from registration and \\n \\n17 no-action positions available for non- U.S. obligors (a)  whose outstanding securities owned by U.S. persons (other \\nthan “knowledgeable employees ”) are owned exclusive ly by Qualified Purchasers and (b)  which do not make a public \\noffering of their securities in the United States.  Accordingly, investors in the Notes will not be accorded the \\nprotections of the Investment Company Act.  Counsel for the Co- Issuers will opine , in connection with the sale of the \\nNotes, that neither of the Co -Issuers is at such time an investment company required to be registered under the \\nInvestment Company Act (assuming, for the purposes of such opinion, the accuracy and completeness of all \\nrepresentations and warranties made or deemed to be made by investors in the Notes).  No opinion or no- action \\nposition has been requested of the SEC.  \\nCertain restrictions limit the transferability of the Classes of Notes affected thereby .  No sale, assignmen t, \\nparticipation, pledge or transfer of the Notes may be effected if, among other things, it would require any of the Issuer, the Co -Issuer or the pool of collateral to register under, or otherwise be subject to the provisions of, the Investment \\nCompany Ac t or any similar legislation or regulatory action.  \\nIf the SEC or a court of competent jurisdiction were to find that the Issuer or the Co- Issuer is required, but in \\nviolation of the Investment Company Act had failed, to register as an investment company, t his will constitute an \\nEvent of Default under the Indenture which, in turn, could lead to acceleration of the Notes and/or liquidation of the \\nPortfolio Assets.  Other possible consequences of a finding that the Issuer or the Co- Issuer is required but in vi olation \\nof the Investment Company Act had failed to register as an investment company include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) the SEC could apply to a district court to enjoin the violation; (ii) investors in the Issuer or the Co- Issuer \\ncould s ue the Issuer or the Co -Issuer, as the case may be, to recover any damages caused by the violation; and (iii) \\nany contract to which the Issuer or the Co- Issuer, as the case may be, is a party that is made in, or whose performance \\ninvolves a, violation of t he Investment Company Act would be unenforceable by any party to the contract unless a \\ncourt were to find that under the circumstances enforcement would produce a more equitable result than non-\\nenforcement and would not be inconsistent with the purposes of  the Investment Company Act. In addition, such a \\nfinding would constitute an Event of Default.  Should the Issuer or the Co- Issuer be subjected to any or all of the \\nforegoing, the Issuer or the Co -Issuer, as the case may be, would be materially and adverse ly affected and, as a result, \\nthe Notes would be materially and adversely affected.  \\nChanges in the legislative and regulatory environment may adversely affect the ability of the Co- Issuers to make \\npayments on the Notes.  \\nLegislation and regulations adopted by the U.S.  federal government following the financial crisis continue to \\ncreate uncertainty in the credit and other financial markets. These actions include, but are not limited to, the enactment of the Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protectio n Act (the “ Dodd- Frank Act ”), which imposed a new \\nregulatory framework over the U.S. financial services industry and the consumer credit markets in general, and the adoption of its related regulations.  Significant questions remain r egarding the proper interpretation of many of these \\nregulations, including the Volcker Rule and U.S. Risk Retention Rules as they relate to collateralized bond obligation vehicles ( “CBOs” ) and other asset -backed securities (other than certain collateralized loan obligations transactions \\ndescribed in the Appeals Court Ruling in the LSTA Case). In addition, there is also uncertainty regarding the nature and timing of additional regulations that are required under the Dodd- Frank Act but have yet t o be promulgated. Given \\nthe broad scope and sweeping nature of these changes, significant unresolved questions regarding the proper \\napplication of the regulations that have been adopted and the fact that final implementing rules and regulations have \\nnot ye t in certain cases been enacted or come into effect, the potential impact of these actions on the Issuer, any of the \\nNotes or any holders of Notes are not yet fully known, and no assurance can be made that the impact of such changes \\nwould not have a materi al adverse effect on the prospects of the Issuer or the value or marketability of the Notes. In \\nparticular, if existing transactions are not exempted from any such new rules or regulations, the costs of compliance \\nwith such rules and regulations could have  a material adverse effect on the Issuer and the holders of Notes. If the \\nIssuer were unable to comply with such rules and regulations (because of excessive cost, unavailability of information \\nor otherwise), an Event of Default could result. Liquidation of  the Portfolio Assets as a result of an Event of Default \\ncould have a material adverse effect on the holders of Notes.  \\nFurthermore, no assurance can be made that the U.S.  federal government or any U.S. regulatory body (or \\nother authority or regulatory body) will not continue to take further legislative or regulatory action, and the effect of \\nsuch actions, if any, cannot be known or predicted.  \\n \\n18 The Volcker Rule may negatively affect the liquidity and value of certain Classes of Notes.  \\nSection 619 of the Dodd- Frank Act added a provision, commonly referred to as the “Volcker Rule, ” to \\nfederal banking laws to generally prohibit various banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading or acquiring \\nor retaining an ownership interest in, sponsoring or having certain relationships with a “ covered fund”  (defined in \\nfinal regulations adopted on December 10, 2013 (the “ Final Volcker Regulations ”), as, among other things, any \\nentity relying on Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act to be exempt from registration \\nunder the Investment Company Act), subject to certain exclusions. The Issuer intends to rely on Section 3(c)(7) and therefore, absent an exclusion, the Issuer would be a covered fund.  \\nOn June 25, 2020, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve and other federal regulators (the “Joint \\nAgencies ”) finalized modifications to the regulations implementing the Volcker Rule (the “ Modified Rule ”), \\nincluding modifications to the definition of a prohibited “ ownership interest ” in a covered fund.  The Modified Rule \\ntook effect on October 1, 2020.  T he Modified Rule alters the definition of “ ownership interest ” in two ways.  First, it \\nclarifies that an interest that allows its holder to participate in the removal of an investment manager for cause, or to \\nnominate or vote on a nominated replacement manager upon an investment manager ’s resignation or removal, whether \\nor not such rights arise  upon the occurrence of an event of default or an acceleration event, would not be considered \\nan ownership interest for this reason alone.  Second, it exclude s from the definition of ownership interest senior loans \\nor debt interests in a covered fund that contain certain characteristics, including that the holders of such interests do \\nnot receive any profits of the covered fund but only interest payments not linked to the performance of the fund and \\nthe return of principal on or before a maturity date, that  the entitlement to interest payments is absolute and not reduced \\nbecause of losses arising from the covered fund, and that the holders are not entitled to receive the underlying assets \\nof the covered fund after all other interests have been paid (excluding the rights of a creditor exercising remedies \\nfollowing an event of default or acceleration event).   \\nThe Issuer has not structured its operations in order to attempt to rely on, and does not intend to qualify for, \\nany exclusion or exemption from the defi nition of “ covered fund”  under the Volcker Rule.  Moreover, notwithstanding \\nthe Modified Rule, no assurance can be given that the Notes will be excluded from the definition of “ownership \\ninterest” .  However, the Issuer is of the view that, under the Volcke r Rule, the Class A Notes  and the Class B Notes  \\nshould not be regarded as “ ownership interests ” in the Issuer.  Prospective investors should make their own \\ndetermination with respect to compliance with the Volcker Rule.  \\nIf the Issuer is determined to be a “ covered fund ” under the Volcker Rule, there would be limitations on the \\nability of banking entities to purchase or retain any Class deemed to be “ ownership interests, ” which would be \\nexpected to include the Preferred Shares, but could also potentially include certain of the Notes .  Accordingly, if any \\nbanking entity determined that its ownership of any Class of Notes caused it to have an “ ownership interest ” in a \\n“covered fund ” within the meaning of the Volcker Rule, an investment in such Class of Notes would not be a suitable \\ninvestment for such banking entity. Depending on market conditions, this could significantly and negatively affect the \\nliquidity and market value of the affected Classes.  Moreover, the ability of t he Initial Purchaser s or the Placement \\nAgent to make a market in the affected Classes would be subject to certain limitations, which could, if the Initial \\nPurchaser s or the Placement Agent otherwise had decided to make a market in such securities, further negatively affect \\nliquidity and market value of the affected Classes.  In addition, if the Issuer were determined to be a covered fund and \\nthe Initial Purchaser or the Placement Agent were determined to have sponsored or organized and offered the Issuer ’s \\nNotes, the Initial Purchaser , the Placement Agent and their respective affiliates may not be permitted to engage in \\ncertain transactions with the Issuer, possibly including the sale of Portfolio Assets  to the Issuer.  This could negatively \\naffect the Issuer and Collateral Manager ’s ability to manage the Portfolio Assets . \\nEach investor in the Notes  must make its own determination as to whether it is subject to the Volcker Rule, \\nwhether its investment in the Notes  would be restricted or prohibited under the Volcker Rule, and the potential impact \\nof the Volcker Rule and the Modified Rule on its investment, any liquidity in connection therewith and on its portfolio generally.   Investors in the Notes  are resp onsible for analysing their own regulatory position, including a determination \\nas to whether they would have an “ ownership interest ” in a covered fund, and none of the Co-Issuers, the Initial \\nPurchaser, the Placement Agent, the Collateral Manager , the Trus tee nor any of their affiliates makes any \\nrepresentation to any prospective investor or purchaser of the Notes  regarding the application of the Volcker Rule or \\nthe Modified Rule to the Issuer, or to such investor ’s investment in the Notes  on the Closing Da te or at any time in \\nthe future.  \\n \\n19 European Legal Investment Considerations and Retention Requirements.  \\nRegulation (EU) 2017/2402 of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 12, 2017 (as \\namended, the “EU Securitization Regulation ”) has direct effect in member states of the European Union (the “ EU”) \\nand is expected to be implemented by national legislation in other countries in the EEA.  Article 5 of the EU \\nSecuritization Regulation places cer tain conditions on investments in a “ securitisation ” (as defined in that regulation) \\n(the “EU Due Diligence Requirements ”) by an “ institutional investor ”, defined to include: (a) insurance undertakings \\nand reinsurance undertakings, each as defined in Directive 2009/138/EC; (b) with certain exceptions, institutions for \\noccupational retirement provision falling within the scope of Directive (EU) 2016/2341, and investment managers and \\nauthorized entities appointed by such institutions pursuant to that Directive; (c) alternative investment fund managers, as defined in Directive 2011/61/EU, that manage and/or market alternative investment funds in the EU; (d) \\nmanagement companies, as defined in Directive 2009/65/EC, of undert akings for collective investment in transferable \\nsecurities ( “UCITS ”) and internally managed UCITS, which are investment companies authorized in accordance with \\nthat Directive which have not designated such a management company for their management; and (e) credit \\ninstitutions and investment firms, each as defined in Regul ation (EU) No 575/2013, known as the Capital \\nRequirements Regulation (the “ CRR” ). The EU Due Diligence Requirements also apply to investments by certain \\nconsolidated affiliates  of such CRR credit institutions and investment firms , wherever established or located, of \\ninstitutions regulated under the CRR (such affiliates, together with all institutional investors referred to in this paragraph, “EU Affected Investors ”). \\nRegulation (EU) 2017/2402 of the European Parliam ent and of the Council of December 12, 2017 (as \\napplicable on December 31, 2020), as retained as part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA and amended by \\nthe Securitisation (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (and as further amended from time to tim e, the “UK \\nSecuritization Regulation ”) has effect in the UK.  Article 5 of the UK Securitization Regulation places certain \\nconditions on investments in a “ securitisation ” (as defined in the UK Securitization Regulation ) (the “ UK Due \\nDiligence Requirements ”) by an “ institutional investor ”, defined to include: (a) insurance undertakings and \\nreinsurance undertakings, as defined in the FSMA; (b) occupational pension schemes, as defined in the Pension \\nSchemes Act 1993, that have their main administration in the  UK, and fund managers of such schemes appointed \\nunder the Pensions Act 1995 that, in respect of activity undertaken pursuant to that appointment, are authori zed for \\nthe purposes of the FSMA; (c) AIFMs, as defined in the Alternative Investment Fund Manager s Regulations 2013, \\nwhich market or manage AIFs, as defined in those Regulations, in the UK; (d) management companies  as defined in \\nsection 237(2) FSMA of UCITS ; (e) UCITS, which are authorized open ended investment companies, as defined in \\nthe FSMA; (f) C RR firms, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue \\nof the EUWA  (as amended, the “UK CRR” ) and (g) an FCA investment firm as defined in the UK CRR . The UK \\nDue Diligence Requirements also apply to investments by certain consolidated affiliates, wherever established or \\nlocated, of such CRR firms (such affiliates, together with all institutional investors referred to in this paragraph, “ UK \\nAffected Inv estors ”). \\nAny person subject to the EU Due Diligence Requirements or the UK Due Diligence Requirements is \\nrequired (among other things), prior to investing in a securitization, to verify certain matters, including that: (a) ce rtain \\ncredit -granting requirements are satisfied; (b) the originator, sponsor or original lender (each as defined in the EU \\nSecuritization Regulation or the UK Securitization Regulation, as applicable) retains on an ongoing basis a material net economic in terest in the securitization which, in any event, will not be less than 5%, in accordance with the EU \\nSecuritization Regulation or the UK Securitization Regulation, as applicable, and discloses that risk retention to investors; (c) in the case of EU Affect ed Investors, the originator, sponsor or securitization special purpose entity \\n(each as defined in the EU Securitization Regulation) has, where applicable, made available the information required by Article 7 of the EU Securitization Regulation in accordan ce with the frequency and modalities provided for in that \\nArticle; and (d) in the case of UK Affected Investors, the originator, sponsor or securitization special purpose entity (each as defined in the UK Securitization Regulation), where established outsi de of the UK, has, where applicable, \\nmade available information which is substantially the same as that which it would have made available in accordance \\nwith Article 7 of the UK Securitization Regulation if it had been established in the UK and has done so  with such \\nfrequency and modalities as are substantially the same as those with which it would have made information available \\nin accordance with Article 7 of the UK Securitization Regulation if it had been so established.  \\nNone of the Collateral Manager, t he Collateral Administrator, the Trustee, the Initial Purchaser s, the \\nPlacement Agent  nor any other party to the transactions described in this Offering Circular, nor any of their respective \\n \\n20 affiliates, undertakes or intends to retain a material net econom ic interest in the securitization constituted by the \\nissuance of the Notes in a manner that would satisfy the requirements of the EU Securitization Regulation or the UK \\nSecuritization Regulation.   \\nIn addition, no such person undertakes or intends to take any other action or refrain from taking any action \\nprescribed or contemplated in, or for purposes of or in connection with, compliance by any EU Affected Investor with the EU Due Diligence Requirements or by any UK Affected Investor with the UK Due Diligence Requirements or to \\ncomply with the requirements of any other law or regulation now or hereafter in effect in the EU, any member state \\nof the EEA or the UK in relation to risk retention, due diligence and monitoring, credit granting standards or any othe r \\nconditions with respect to investments in securitization transactions by investors.  \\nFailure by an EU Affected Investor to comply with the EU Due Diligence Requirements or by a UK Affected \\nInvestor to comply with the UK Due Diligence Requirements with res pect to an investment in the Notes may result in \\nthe imposition of a penalty regulatory capital charge on that investment or of other regulatory sanctions or remedial \\nmeasures by such investor ’s competent authority.  \\nRelevant investors in -scope of the EU Securitiz ation Regulation or the UK Securiti zation Regulation should \\nalso note that both regimes provide for certain restrictions on third country jurisdictions in which securitization special \\npurpose entities ( “SSPEs ”) may be established. In particular, the UK Securitiz ation Regulation provides for a \\nrestriction on the establishment of SSPEs in (amongst other places) countries outside the UK that are listed as high -\\nrisk and non- cooperative jurisdictions by the Financial Action Task Force ( “FATF ”). The EU Securiti zation \\nRegulation restricts the establishment of SSPEs in (amongst other places) jurisdictions that are listed by the EU as \\njurisdictions that have strategic deficiencies in its regime on anti- money launderi ng and counter terrorist financing \\n(“EU AML/CFT List ”). It should be noted that the Issuer is established in the Cayman Islands and that in February \\n2021 the FATF added the Cayman Islands to its separate list of jurisdictions under increased monitoring because strategic deficiencies have been identified in their regimes to counter money laundering, terrorist financing, and \\nproliferation financing. The UK Securiti zation Regulation does not prohibit SSPEs from being established in coun tries \\nlisted on the EU AML/CFT List but such investors should note that on March 26, 2021, the UK added the Cayman \\nIslands to its list of high -risk countries for anti -money laundering purposes pursuant to The Money Laundering, \\nTerrorist Financing and Trans fer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017 (as amended) . On 22 February \\n2022 the EU introduced EC Regulation 2022/229 which, with effect from 13 March 2022, added the Cayman Islands \\nto the EU AML/CFT List and which may have adverse consequenc es for relevant institutional investors under the EU \\nSecuritiz ation Regulation although the exact consequences are unclear.  \\nConsequently, the Notes may not be a suitable investment for EU Affected Investors or UK Affected \\nInvestors. As a result, the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market may be adversely affected.  \\nProspective investors are responsible for analyzing their own legal and regulatory position and are advised \\nto consult with their own investment and legal advisors regarding the suitability of the Notes for investment and the scope, applicability and compl iance requirements of the EU Securitization Regulation and UK Securitization \\nRegulation and none of the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Administrator, the Trustee, the Initial \\nPurchaser , the Placement Agent  nor any other party to the transac tions described in this Offering Circular, nor any of \\ntheir respective affiliates makes any representations in respect thereof . \\nEU and UK Regulatory Requirements Applicable to Investment Funds May Adversely Affect the Issuer.   \\nEach of EU Directive 2011/61 /EU on Alternative Investment Fund Managers, as amended ( “AIFMD ”) and \\nthe UK Alternative Investment Fund Managers Regulations 2013, as amended ( “UK AIFMR ”) provides that \\nalternative investment funds ( “AIFs” ) in the EU and the UK, respectively, must have a designated alternative \\ninvestment fund manager (an “AIFM” ) with responsibility for portfolio and risk management. Although the portfolio \\nand risk management provisions of AIFMD apply only to EEA AIFM s and the portfolio and risk management \\nprovisions of UK AIFMR apply only to UK AIFMs, in each case when managing any AIF, the disclosure and transparency requirements of AIFMD and UK AIFMR, as applicable, apply to non -EEA and non- UK AIFs which are \\nto be m arketed in the EEA and the UK, respectively. Securitization issuers , including the Co- Issuers, are generally \\ntaking the position that they are not AIFs that are subject to the jurisdiction of AIFMD or UK AIFMR because they \\nqualify for the exemption for “ securitization special purpose entities ” or because the issuance of the Notes constitutes \\na “collective investment scheme”  (within the meaning of section 235 of FSMA) falling outside the scope of the \\n \\n21 AIFMD and UK AIFMR, as applicable, in certain  circumstan ces. It is possible, however, that this position could \\nchange in the event that one or more European regulatory authorities or the UK Financial Conduct Authority (the \\n“FCA” ) expresses a view that such exemption or exclusion is not available to securitization issuers . If AIFMD or UK \\nAIFMR were to apply to a Co -Issuer as a non -EEA or non -UK AIF marketed in the EEA and/or the UK, such Co-\\nIssuer would be subject to the disclosure and transparency requirements of AIFMD and/or UK AIFMR, as applicable,  \\nwhich require, among other things, that investors in the EEA and the UK, respectively, receive initial and periodic \\ndisclosures concerning any AIF which is marketed to them; that annual financial reports of the AIF must be prepared in compliance with the AIFMD or UK AIFMR, as applicable, and made available to investors; that periodic reports \\nrelating to the AIF must be filed with the competent regulatory authority in each member state of the EEA in which \\nthe fund has been marketed or, if the fund is market ed in the UK, with the FCA  (and additional requirements may \\napply in certain EEA member states in which a C o-Issuer is marketed if AIFMD were to apply to it as a non -EEA \\nAIF).  All or any of these regulatory requirements may adversely affect the Collateral  Manager ’s ability to achieve \\nthe Co -Issuers’  investment objectives and may result in additional costs and expenses for the Co- Issuers. In addition, \\nit is unclear whether or not the Co -Issuers would be able to comply with such disclosure requirements.  \\nU.S. Risk Retention Requirements . \\nOn October 21\\nst and 22nd, 2014, six federal agencies (the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the \\nComptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Securities and Exchange \\nCommission, th e Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency \\n(collectively, the “ U.S. Regulators ”)) adopted joint final rules implementing the credit risk retention requirements of \\nSection 941 of the Dodd- Frank Act, which were published in the Federal Register on December 24, 2014 (together \\nwith any  additional requirements, rules, regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder from time to time, the “ U.S. \\nRisk Retention Rules ”).  The U.S. Risk Retention Rules became fully effective on December 24, 2016. The \\ndiscussion in this risk factor is (and statements contained els ewhere in this Offering Circular regarding the U.S. Risk \\nRetention Rules are) based solely on publicly available information (including the LSTA Case and the U.S. Risk \\nRetention Rules as published in the federal register) as of the date of this Offering Ci rcular.  \\nExcept with respect to asset -backed securities transactions that satisfy certain exemptions and to certain \\ncollateralized loan obligations transactions described in the Appeals Court Ruling in the LSTA Case, the U.S. Risk \\nRetention Rules require th at either the “sponsor ” of a “securitization transaction ” or a “majority -owned affiliate ” \\nthereof (in each case as defined therein) retain an “ eligible vertical interest”  or an “ eligible horizontal residual interest”  \\n(in each case as defined therein) or an y combination thereof in the securitized assets in the manner required by the \\nU.S. Risk Retention Rules. The U.S. Risk Retention Rules define “ eligible vertical interest”  to mean, with respect to \\nany securitization transaction, a single vertical security o r an interest in each class of ABS interests in the issuing \\nentity issued as part of such securitization transaction that constitutes the same proportion (and at least five percent (5.0%)) of each such class. The U.S. Risk Retention Rules define “ eligible horizontal residual interest”  to mean, with \\nrespect to any securitization transaction, an ABS interest in the issuing entity (1) that is an interest in a single class or  \\nmultiple classes in the issuing entity, provided that each interest meets, individually or in the aggregate, all of the \\nrequirements of the definition of “ eligible horizontal residual interest” ; (2) with respect to which, on any payment date \\nor allocation date on which the issuing entity has insufficient funds to satisfy its obligation to pay all contractual \\ninterest or principal due, any resulting shortfall will reduce amounts payable to the “ eligible horizontal residual \\ninterest”  prior to any reduction in the amounts payable to any other ABS interest, whether through loss allocation, \\nopera tion of the priority of payments, or any other governing contractual provision (until the amount of such ABS \\ninterest is reduced to zero); and (3) that, with the exception of any non- economic REMIC residual interest, has the \\nmost subordinated claim to paym ents of both principal and interest by the issuing entity. In the context of the \\ntransaction described herein, the term “ ABS interests ” would include each Class of Notes and the Preferred Shares.  \\nOn February 9, 2018, a three judge panel (the “DC Circuit Pa nel”) of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \\nDistrict of Columbia Circuit (the “ Appeals Court ”) held in the legal action captioned The Loan Syndications and \\nTrading Association v Securities and Exchange Commission  and Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System , \\nNo. 1:16- cv-0065 (the “ LSTA Case ”), that CLO managers of “ open market CLOs ” are not “ securitizers ” under \\nSection 941 of the Dodd -Frank Act and, therefore, are not subject to risk retention, and ordered the U.S.  District Court \\nfor the District of Columbia (the “ Trial Court ”) to vacate the U.S. Risk Retention Rules insofar as they apply to CLO \\nmanagers of “ open -market CLOs ” (the “Appeals Court Ruling ”).  On April 3, 2018, the Appeals Court  issued a \\nformal mandate with respect to the Appeals Court Ruling  (the “Mandate ”), and on April 5, 2018, the Trial Court  \\n \\n22 issued an order vacating the U.S. Risk Retention Rules insofar as they apply to investment managers of open- market \\nCLOs (the “ Vacating Order ”).  The applicable governmental agencies could have challenged the Appeals Court \\nRuling  by filing a petition for rehearing by the DC Circuit Panel or by an en banc  panel of the Appeals Cour t by \\nMarch 26, 2018 or by petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari by May 10, 2018, but they did not do \\nso and may no longer do so now that the deadlines for submission of a petition for rehearing and for petitioning the \\nU.S. Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari have passed.   \\nThere is no established line of authority or precedent that provides definitive guidance on the U.S. Risk \\nRetention Rules (except for the Appeals Court Ruling in the LSTA Case ) and the U.S. Risk Retention Rules may \\nchange or may be superseded by changes in law, guidance from the applicable government agencies or any additional guidance or views any particular regulator may provide that would result in consequences materially different from \\nthe statements herein. No assurance can be made whether or not any governmental authority will take further \\nlegislative or regulatory action in response to pas t or future economic crises or otherwise, and the effect (and extent) \\nof such actions, if any, cannot be known or predicted.  \\nTaking into account the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, the Appeals Court Ruling and other available information, \\nthe Collateral Manage r has determined that it is not required to acquire or retain securities issued by the Co -Issuers.  \\nThis determination is not free from doubt, particularly in light of the lack of explicit guidance from regulators as to \\nhow to apply the U.S. Risk Retention Rules to a transaction such as the one described herein, and the differences \\nbetween this transaction and the open- market C LOs discussed in the Appeals Court Ruling.  In particular, the Appeals \\nCourt Ruling only discussed in limited detail the characteris tics of an open- market CLO and did not address certain \\nfeatures present in this transaction such as (i)  that the Portfolio Assets  are not syndicated bank loans and (ii) that some \\nof the Portfolio Assets  have been acquired from securitization vehicles manag ed by the Collateral Manager or one of \\nits Affiliates, securitization vehicles wherein funds managed by the Collateral Manager or one of its Affiliates were equity investors and funds and accounts managed by an Affiliate of the Collateral Manager.  Therefo re, there is \\nuncertainty as to how a relevant governmental authority would apply the Appeals Court Ruling to this transaction.   \\nMoreover, lawmakers may elect to engage in additional legislative action and/or rulemaking procedures to \\ndetermine whether and how to apply the U.S. Risk Retention Rules to transactions such as the one described herein in light of the Appeals Court Decision, which could result in other persons related to the transaction being designated as \\na sponsor or other unexpected results.  A ny changes or further guidance may, to the extent the U.S. Risk Retention \\nRules apply, result in other parties with an interest in the transaction potentially incurring obligations under the U.S. \\nRisk Retention Rules, and if such person were to thereunder fail to comply with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, such \\nfailure may have a material adverse effect on the Issuer and the Note s.  In general, no assurance can be given that the \\nU.S. Risk Retention Rules will not change or be superseded by changes in law.  \\nFurther, the SEC has indicated  in contexts separate from the U.S. Risk Retention Rules that an “ offer”  or a \\n“sale” of securities may arise when amendments to securities  are so material as to require holders  to make an \\n“investment decision ” with respect to such amendment .  Thus, if the  SEC were to take a similar position with respect \\nto the U.S. Risk Retention Rules at a time when the U.S. Risk Retention Rules applied in connection with issuances \\nof securities by the Issuer, they could apply to material amendments to the Indenture or the Notes to the extent such \\namendments in effect require investors to make an investment decision.  Were that to occur, the U.S. Risk Retention \\nRules may adversely affect the Issuer (and the performance, market value and/or liquidity of the Note s) if the Issuer \\nis unable to undertake any such additional issuance, Refinancing or other material amendment.  To the extent the \\nCollateral Manager ’s consent is required for any such action, it should be expected that the  Collateral Manager in \\ngranting or withholding such consent will act in its own self -interest (and will not take into account the interests of \\nany other Person, including the Issuer and/or any Holders of Note s) and not consent to any of the foregoing actio ns if \\nto do so might cause the Collateral Manager or its Affiliates to be concerned about its ability to comply with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules.  \\nThe statements contained in this Offering Circular  regarding the expected applicability of the U.S. Risk \\nRetention Rules are solely based on publicly available information as of the date of this Offering Circular, including \\nthe U.S. Risk Retention Rules as published in the federal register, the Appeals Court Ruling and the order of the DC District Court implemen ting the Appeals Court Ruling.  \\n \\n23 In addition, the impact of the U.S. Risk Retention Rules on the debt securitization market and the Bank \\nSubordinated Note  market generally are uncertain. It is possible that the U.S. Risk Retention Rules may reduce the \\nnumber  of collateral managers active in the market, which may result in fewer new issue CBOs and reduce the liquidity \\nprovided by CBOs to the Bank Subordinated Note  market generally. A contraction or reduced liquidity in the debt \\nmarket could reduce opportunitie s for the Collateral Manager to sell Portfolio Assets when it believes it is in the \\nIssuer ’s interest to do so, which in turn could negatively impact the return on the collateral and reduce the market \\nvalue or liquidity of the Notes. Any reduction in the volume and liquidity provided by CBOs to the Bank Subordinated \\nNote  market could also reduce opportunities to redeem the Notes in an Optional Redemption by Refinancing or an \\nOptional Redemption by Liquidation, and could negatively affect the ability of the obligors to obtain refinancing of \\ntheir Portfolio Assets, which could result in an increase in Defaulted Securities above historical levels. In addition, if \\nthere are fewer collateral managers in the debt market, this will further limit the opportunity to select a successor \\nCollateral Manager should one be needed at any time for this transaction.   \\nRecent Developments Concerning Japanese Risk Retention Requirements.  \\nThe Japanese Financial Services Agency (the “ JFSA ”) recently published a risk re tention rule as part of the \\nregulatory capital regulation of certain categories of Japanese investors seeking to invest in securitization transactions \\n(the “JRR Rule ”). The JRR Rule  mandates an ‘ indirect’  risk retention  compliance requirement, meaning that certain \\ncategories of Japanese investors will be required to apply higher risk weighting to securitization exposures they hold \\nunless (i) the relevant originator commits to hold a retention interest equal to at least  5% of the exposure of the  total \\nunderlying assets in the transaction (the “ Japanese Retention Requirement ”) or (ii) such investors determine that \\nthe underlying assets were not “ inappropriately originated. ”  In the abs ence of such a determination with respect to \\nthe Portfolio Assets  by such investors, the  Japanese Retention Requirement as set out in the JRR Rule  will apply to \\nan investment by such investors in the Notes. The Japanese investors to which the JRR Rule appl ies include banks, \\nbank holding companies, credit unions ( shinyo kinko ), credit cooperatives ( shinyo kumiai ), labour credit unions ( rodo \\nkinko ), agricultural credit cooperatives ( nogyo kyodo kumiai ), ultimate parent companies of large securities companies \\nand certain other financial institutions regulated in Japan  (such investors, “Japanese Affected Investors ”). Such \\nJapanese Affected Investors may be subject to punitive capital requirements and/or other regulatory penalties with \\nrespect to investments in securitizations that fail to comply with the Japanese Retention Requirement .  \\nThe JRR Rule became effective on March 31, 2019.  At this time, each Per son receiving this Offering Circular  \\nshould understand that there are a  number of unresolved questions  and no established line of authority, precedent or \\nmarket practice that provides definitive guidance with respect to the JRR Rule, and  no assurances can be made as to \\nthe cont ent, impact  or interpretation of the JRR Rule .  In particular, the basis for the determination of whether an asset \\nis “inappropriately originated ” remains unclear, and therefore unless the JFSA  provides further specific clarification,  \\nit is possible that this transaction may contain assets deemed to be “ inappropriately originated”  and as a result may \\nnot be exempt from the Japanese Retention Requirement .  The JRR Rule or other similar requirements may deter \\nJapanese Affected Investors from purchasing Notes, which may limit the liquidity of the Notes  and adversely affect \\nthe price of the Notes in the secondary market.  Whether and to what extent the  JFSA  may pro vide further clarification  \\nor interpretation as to the JRR Rule is unknown.   \\n Each purchaser or prospective purchaser of Notes is itself  responsible for monitoring and assessing any \\nchanges to Japanese risk retention laws and regulations, including any del egated or implementing legislation made \\npursuant to the JRR Rule, and for analyzing its own regulatory position.  Each purchaser or prospective purchaser of \\nNotes is advised to consult with its own advisers regarding the suitability of the Notes for in vestment and the \\napplicability of the JRR Rule and the Japanese Retention Requirement  to this transaction. None of the Issuer, the Co-\\nIssuer, the Initial Purchaser s, the Placement Agent, the Collateral Manager , the Trustee or any of their respective \\nAffiliates  makes any representation or agreement regarding compliance with the JRR Rule or the consequences of the \\nJRR Rule for any Person, including any Japanese Affected Investor, and none of the Issuer, the Co- Issuer, the Initial \\nPurchaser s, the Placement Agent, the Collateral Manager , the Trustee or any of their respective Affiliates intends to \\ntake any steps to comply (or facilitate compliance by any Person, including any Japanese Affected Investor) with the JRR Rule or makes any representation, warranty or agre ement regarding compliance with the JRR Rule or the \\nconsequences of the JRR Rule for any Person . \\n \\nRecent Proposed Private Fund Rules  to the Investment Advisers Act . \\n \\n \\n24 On February 9, 2022, the SEC proposed certain rules and amendments under the Investment Advisers Act to \\nenhance the regulation of private fund advisers (the “ Proposed Private Fund Rules ”) that, if adopted in their current  \\nform, would affect investment advisers, including the Collateral Manager, by (i) requiring such investment advisers \\nto comply with additional reporting and compliance obligations, (ii) prohibiting certain business practices, (iii) \\nprohibiting certain type s of preferential treatment offered by such investment advisers to certain (but not all) investors \\nin a private fund, including, among other things, the provision of information regarding portfolio holdings of the private fund or of a substantially similar  pool of assets, and (iv) prohibiting other forms of preferential treatment for \\ncertain (but not all) investors without providing sufficiently detailed written disclosures about such preferential \\ntreatment to prospective and current investors. Section 202( a)(29) of the Investment Advisers Act defines the term \\n“private fund”  as an issuer that would be an investment company under the Investment Company Act but for the \\nexemption provided under Sections 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) thereunder. Because the Issuer will rel y on Section 3(c)(7) of \\nthe Investment Company Act, it will be considered a “ private fund”  within the meaning of the Proposed Private Fund \\nRules, and the Collateral Manager could be required to comply with the enhanced obligations under the Proposed \\nPrivat e Fund Rules. The costs of complying with certain of the reporting and compliance obligations under the \\nProposed Private Fund Rules could be substantial, and it is unclear if the costs of preparing such reports would be \\nborne by the Issuer or the Collatera l Manager. If the Issuer is responsible for such expenses, it could affect the Issuer ’s \\nability to make payments on the Notes and reduce amounts available for distribution to the holders of the Preferred Shares . In addition, if the Collateral Manager was p rohibited from discussing the underlying portfolio of Portfolio \\nAssets with investors, or if certain types of side letters were prohibited absent highly specific disclosure, it could result \\nin a reduction of the quality and quantity of information provided to holders of the Notes, and could have a negative \\neffect on the Collateral Manager ’s ability to manage C BO transactions.  \\n \\nThere is no “ grandfathering”  under the Proposed Private Fund Rules, and therefore the Collateral Manager \\nwould be obligated to compl y with the Proposed Private Fund Rules with respect to the Issuer and any other \\ntransactions or other private funds that it manages within one year after the effective date of the final rule. There can \\nbe no assurance that the Proposed Private Fund Rules w ill be adopted in the form proposed, or at all, and if adopted \\nin any form, when such Proposed Private Fund Rules would take effect. Each investor in the Notes must make its own \\ndetermination as to whether its investment in the Notes would be affected by t he Proposed Private Fund Rules, and \\nthe potential impact of the Proposed Private Fund Rules on its investment, any liquidity in connection therewith and \\non its portfolio generally. None of the Issuer, the Co- Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the Trustee, the Collateral \\nAdministrator, the Initial Purchasers , the Placement Agent  nor any of their respective affiliates makes any \\nrepresentation to any prospective investor or purchaser of the Notes regarding the application of the Proposed Private Fund Rules to the  Collateral Manager and/or the Issuer on the Closing Date or at any time in the future.  \\nOther changes . \\nNo assurance can be made that the U.S. federal government or any U.S. regulatory body (or other authority \\nor regulatory body) will not continue to take further legislative or regulatory action in response to any  financial crisis \\nor otherwise, and the effec t of such actions, if any, cannot be known or predicted.   \\nAll prospective investors in the Notes whose investment activities are subject to legal investment laws and \\nregulations, regulatory capital requirements, or review by regulatory authorities should consult with their own legal, \\naccounting and other advisors in determining whether, and to what extent, the Notes will constitute legal investments \\nfor them or are subject to investment or other restrictions, unfavorable accounting treatment, capital charges, reserve \\nrequirements or other consequences.  \\nWithdrawal of the United Kingdom  or other countries  from the Europe an Union could adversely affect the ability \\nof the Co -Issuers to make payments on the Notes.  \\nThe United Kingdom (the “ UK”) has wit hdrawn from the EU.  Such withdrawal is commonly  referred to as \\n“Brexit ”. With effect on and from Jan uary 1, 2021 the UK is no longer subject to European law or treated as a member \\nstate of the EU.  There remains uncertainty surrounding the implementation and implications of Brexit for example with respect to the costs and practicalities of the ongoing tra ding arrangements between the EU and the UK, whether \\nBrexit will have a negative impact on the UK or the broader global economy and any impact on the value of the British pound.  Brexit is likely to create an uncertain political, legal and economic environment in the UK and potentially \\n \\n25 across the member states of the EU and in global markets for the foreseeable future. That uncertainty may in turn \\nadversely impact the liquidity and/or market value of the Notes  and/or the Portfolio Assets . \\n  Moreover, these uncertainties and instabilities could have an adverse impact on the business, financial \\ncondition, results of operations and prospects of the obligors under the Portfolio Assets , and therefore their ability to \\nmake the payments due under the Portfolio Asse ts, which could then have a material and adverse effect on the Issuer, \\nthe Collateral Manager and the other Transaction Parties to the transaction and could therefore also be materially detrimental to Holders of Note s, and such developments cannot be predi cted.  \\nRegulatory and Accounting Treatment . \\nFrom time to time, the a pplicable regulator of a Portfolio Asset Issuer of Portfolio Assets may issue rules or \\nregulations that may impact the regulatory capital treatment of the Portfolio Assets, as described below. There can be no assurance that such rules or regulations, if issued, would not adversely affect the regulatory capital treatment of the \\nPortfolio Assets. Such action may permit a Portfolio Asset Issuer of Portfolio Assets, upon the receipt of any requi red \\nregulatory approval, to directly or indirectly cause a redemption of the Portfolio Assets. In addition, there can be no \\nassurance that such rules or regulations, if issued, would not provide an incentive for an issuer of Portfolio Assets to \\nredeem, dir ectly or indirectly, the Portfolio Assets in accordance with their terms. Any such redemptions would result \\nin earlier payments on the Notes.  \\nMoney laundering prevention laws may require certain actions or disclosures.  \\nThe Uniting and Strengthening America  by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct \\nTerrorism Act of 2001, as amended (the “ USA PATRIOT Act ”), signed into law on and effective as of October 26, \\n2001, requires that financial institutions, a term that  includes banks, broker dealers and investment companies, \\nestablish and maintain compliance programs to guard against money laundering activities.  The USA PATRIOT Act requires the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe regulations in connection with anti -money laundering policies of \\nfinancial institutions. The U.S. Federal Reserve Board, the Treasury and the SEC are currently studying what types of \\ninvestment vehicles should be required to adopt anti -money laundering procedures, and it is unclear at this t ime \\nwhether such procedures will apply to pooled investment vehicles such as the Co- Issuers. Future rules and regulations \\nregarding money laundering or proceeds of crime could regulate the Issuer or the Co- Issuer. In addition, in April 2000, \\nthe Treasury p ublished proposed regulations that would require certain investment advisors to establish an anti -money \\nlaundering program. It is possible that there could be promulgated legislation or regulations that would require the \\nIssuer, the Co -Issuer, the Initial Purchaser s, the Placement Agent,  the Collateral Manager or other service providers \\nto the Co -Issuers, in connection with the establishment of anti -money laundering procedures, to share information \\nwith governmental authorities with respect to investors in the Notes.  Such legislation and/or regulations could require the Co -Issuers to implement additional restrictions on the transfer of the Notes. The Co- Issuers reserve the right to \\nrequest such information as is necessary to verify the identity  of investors in the Notes, and the source of the payment \\nof subscription monies, or as is necessary to comply with any customer identification programs required by Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and/or the SEC. In the event of delay or failure by the applicant to produce any information required for verification purposes, an application for or transfer of the Notes and the subscription monies \\nrelating thereto may be refused.  \\nCayman Islands Anti -Money Laundering Legislation \\nEach of the Administrator a nd the Issuer is subject to the Anti- Money Laundering Regulations ( As Revised ) \\nof the Cayman Islands (together with The Guidance Notes on the Prevention and Detection of Money Laundering,  \\nTerrorist Financing and Proliferation Financing in the Cayman Islands (or equivalent legislation and guidance, as \\napplicable), and each as amended and revised from time to time, “ Cayman AML Regulations ”).  The Cayman AML \\nRegulations apply to anyone conducting “ relevant financial business ” in or from the Cayman Islands intending to form \\na business relationship or carry out a one -off transaction.  The Cayman AML Regulations require a financial service \\nprovider to maintain certain anti- money laundering procedures including those for the purposes of verifying the \\nidentity and source of funds of an “ applicant for business ”; e.g. an investor, as well as the identity of the beneficial \\nowner/controller of the investor, where applicable.  Except in certain circumstances, including where an e ntity is \\nregulated by a recognized overseas regulatory authority and/or listed on a recogniz ed stock exchange in an approved \\njurisdiction, the Issuer , or its agent  will likely be required to verify each investor ’s identity and may be required to \\n \\n26 verify the source of t he payment used by such investor in a manner similar to the obligations imposed under the laws \\nof other major financial cent ers.  Application of an identity verification exemption at the time of purchase of the Notes \\nor Preferred Shares may nevertheless require verification of identity prior to payment of proceeds from the Notes or \\nPreferred Shares. In addition, if any person in the Cayman Islands knows or suspects, or has reasonable grounds for \\nknowing or suspecting that another person is engaged in criminal conduct or money laundering, or is involved with \\nterrorism or terrorist financing and property, and the information for that knowledge or suspicion came to their \\nattention in the course of business in the regulated sector, or other trade, profession, bu siness or employment, the \\nperson will be required to report such knowledge or suspicion to (i) the Financial Reporting Authority of the Cayman \\nIslands ( “FRA” ), pursuant to the Proceeds of Crime Act (As Revised ) of the Cayman Islands ( “PCA”), if the \\ndisclosure relates to criminal conduct or money laundering, or (ii) a police officer of the rank of constable or higher, \\nor the FRA, pursuant to the Terrorism Act (As Revised ) of the Cayman Islands ( “Terrorism Act”), if the disclosure \\nrelates to involvement with terrorism or terrorist financing and property.  If the Issuer were determined by the Cayman Islands authorities to be in violation of the PC A, the Terrorism Act or the Cayman AML Regulations, the Issuer could \\nbe subject to substantial criminal penalties and/or administrative fines.  The Issuer may be subject to similar \\nrestrictions in other jurisdictions.  Such a violation could materially adversely affect the timing and amount of \\npayments by the Issuer to the holders of the Notes or Preferred Shares.  \\nCertain information regarding Holders will be provided upon request to the Issuer or Co- Issuer, as applicable, \\nthe Collateral Manager and other Holders, including for purposes of tax filings. In addition, the Issuer may be required \\nto report certain inform ation regarding the identity of Holders and beneficial owners to the Cayman Islands Tax \\nInformation Authority in order to comply with the Cayman FATCA Legislation .  In addition, if any Transaction Parties \\nare or become subject to anti -money laundering and anti -terrorism, economic and trade sanctions, anti -corruption or \\nanti-bribery laws and regulations, they will disclose any information required or requested by authorities in connection \\ntherewith, including the identity of Holders and beneficial owners.  \\nRisks Relating to the Notes  \\nInvestor suitability . \\nAn investment in the Notes will not be appropriate for all investors. Structured investment products like the \\nNotes are complex instruments, and typically involve a high degree of risk and are intended for sale only to \\nsophisticated investors who are capable of understanding and assuming the risks involved. In recent years, securities \\nissued in securitization transactions have experienced historically high volatility and significant fluctuations in market \\nvalue. Any investor interested in purchasing Notes should conduct its own investigation and analysis of the product \\nand consult its own professional advisers as to the risks involved in making such a purchase.  \\nThe Notes are limited recourse obligations; inve stors must rely on available collections from the Trust Estate and \\nwill have no other source for payment . \\nThe Co -Issued Notes will be limited recourse obligations of the Co -Issuers and the Issuer -Only Notes will \\nbe limited recourse obligations of the Issue r; therefore the Notes are payable solely from the Trust Estate (including \\nthe Portfolio Assets pledged to secure the Notes) as applied in accordance with the Priority of Payments. The Issuer, as a special purpose company, will have no significant assets other than the Portfolio Assets and the Accounts. The \\nCo-Issuer will have no significant assets. Except for the applicable Co- Issuers, no person or entity will be obligated \\nto make any payments on the Notes. The Notes are not deposits or other obligations o f any bank or other depository \\ninstitution and are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “ FDIC ”) or any governmental \\nagency or instrumentality thereof. Consequently, Noteholders must rely solely upon collections on the Portfolio Assets for the payment of amounts payable in respect of the Notes. If collections on the Portfolio Assets are insufficient to \\nmake payments on the Notes, no other assets of the Issuer, the Co- Issuer or any other person or entity will be available  \\nfor the payment of the deficiency and, following liquidation of all of the Trust Estate, the obligations of the Co- Issuers \\non the Notes will be extinguished and will not thereafter be revived. Each owner of Notes or Preferred Shares by its acceptance of s uch Notes or Preferred Shares will agree or be deemed to have agreed not to take any action or institute \\nany proceedings against the Co- Issuers or any Blocker Subsidiary under any insolvency law applicable to the Co-\\nIssuers or any Blocker Subsidiary or whi ch would be likely to cause the Co- Issuers or any Blocker Subsidiary to be \\nsubject to, or to seek the protection of, any insolvency law applicable to the Co- Issuers or any Blocker Subsidiary.  \\n \\n27 The Notes are not guaranteed by the Co- Issuers, the Initial Purc haser s, the Placement Agent, the Collateral \\nManager, the Collateral Administrator, the Administrator or the Trustee . \\nNone of the Co- Issuers, the Initial Purchaser s, the Placement Agent, the Collateral Manager, the Collateral \\nAdministrator, the Administrato r or the Trustee or any Affiliate  thereof makes any assurance, guarantee or \\nrepresentation whatsoever as to the expected or projected success, profitability, return, performance result, effect, \\nconsequence or benefit (including legal, regulatory, tax, fina ncial, accounting or otherwise) to any investor of \\nownership of the Notes, and no investor may rely on any such party for a determination of expected or projected success, profitability, return, performance result, effect, consequence or benefit (including  legal, regulatory, tax, \\nfinancial, accounting or otherwise) to any investor of ownership of the Notes. Each holder will be required to represent \\n(or, deemed to represent) to the Co -Issuers, the Collateral Manager , the Initial Purchaser s and the Placement Agent , \\namong other things, that it has consulted with its own legal, regulatory, tax, business, investment, financial, and \\naccounting advisors regarding investment in the Notes as it has deemed necessary and that the investment by it is \\nwithin its powers a nd authority, is permissible under applicable laws governing such purchase, has been duly \\nauthorized by it and complies with applicable securities laws and other laws.  \\nSubordination, Remedies . \\nPayments on the Notes are subordinated to the payment of certai n fees and expenses of the Issuer and are \\nsubject to the Priority of Payments. Except as otherwise described herein, the order of priority of right to payment of \\nthe Classes of Notes and the Preferred Shares, from most senior to most junior, shall be in ac cordance with the Order \\nof Seniority. Notwithstanding the Order of Seniority, so long as acceleration has not occurred following an Event of \\nDefault, interest on Notes and distributions of Excess Collections to the Holders of the Preferred Shares, will be \\npayable prior to principal on Notes more senior in the Order of Seniority, except that if any Par Coverage Test is not \\nsatisfied, payments of interest on the Notes (other than the Class A Notes) and distributions of Excess Collections to the Holders of the  Preferred Shares, will be subordinated to payments of principal on Notes that are more senior in the \\nOrder of Seniority until such Par Coverage Test has been satisfied.  See Article XI of the Indenture.  \\nCertain Par Coverage Tests and other requirements of the Indenture may require an early repayment of the \\nmore senior Classes of Notes, which will reduce or even eliminate amounts available to make payments on more \\njunior Classes of Notes, resulting in a deferral of interest or loss of interest and principal.   \\nIn addition, so long as Notes that are more senior in the Order of Seniority are Outstanding, the Interest \\nDeferrable Notes provide for deferral of interest if the amounts available for payment of interest on such Notes in \\naccordance with the Priority of  Payments is insufficient to pay such interest in full. Any such deferred interest will be \\nadded to the principal amount of such Notes and will bear interest at the Applicable Interest Rate, and such deferral \\nwill not be an Event of Default under the Indenture.  \\nIf a Default or an Event of Default occurs, certain remedies and other rights under the transaction documents \\nwill only be exercisable by holders of a specified percentage of the aggregate outstanding amount of one or more Classes of Notes. The exercise of such rights could be adverse to holders of Notes that do not have the ability to \\nexercise such rights, and the failure to exercise a right because holders of a Class or a portion of a Class must act in \\nconcert with one or more other Classes to exerc ise such right and insufficient holders are willing to do so could also \\nbe adverse to holders of one or more Classes of Notes. When exercising its rights under the transaction documents, a \\nholder has no obligation to take into account the effect on other holders. If one or more other affiliated owners hold a \\nsignificant percentage of the aggregate outstanding amount of one or more Classes of Notes at any time, it may be \\nmore difficult for other holders to take certain actions.  \\nOnce an Event of Default and acceleration have occurred, no Class of Notes (other than the Class A Notes) \\nwill be entitled to receive any payments until the Holders of all Classes of Notes that are more senior in the Order of Seniority have been paid in full.  \\n \\n28 The Co -Issuers may modify the Indenture by supplemental indentures and some supplemental indentures do not \\nrequire consent of holders of Notes .  \\nThe Indenture provides that the Co- Issuers and the Trustee may enter into supplemental indentures to modify \\nvarious provisions of the Indenture. Execution of supplemental indentures is subject to various conditions precedent. \\nIn certain cases, the consent of holders of Notes is required, but, in certain other cases, such consent is not required or \\nis only required from less than 100% of a Class that would be materially and adversely affected by the amendment or \\nsupplemental indenture. Accordingly, the Notes  of a Class may be materially and adversely affected by an amendment \\nor supplemental indenture that is entered into following consent thereto by less than 100% of such Class.   \\nIssuance of Additional Securities . \\nThe Issuer or the Co -Issuers, as applicable,  are permitted, subject to certain restrictions, to issue additional \\nNotes of any Class, additional Preferred Shares, and/or any new class of securities that is subordinate to the Note s but \\nsenior to the Preferred Shares . If additional Notes of an existing Class are issued, it is possible for existing holders to \\nhave their voting and control power diluted by such additional issuance.  \\nAdditional  issuances may have different terms and may have the effect of preventing the failure of the Par \\nCoverage Tests and the occurrence of an Event of Default . \\nOn any Business Day, the Co- Issuers (or the Issuer) at the direction of the Collateral Manager, may issue and \\nsell (i) additional Notes of any one or more Classes on a pro rata basis with any other Class of Notes , including in \\nconnection with a Risk Retention Issuance , (ii) additional Preferred Shares, and/or (iii) additional securities of one or \\nmore new classes that are fully subordinated to the outstanding Classes of Notes (but that are senior to the Preferred Shares) and use the net proceeds to purchase additional Portfolio Assets or for other purposes permitted under the \\nIndenture if the conditions for such additional issuance described under Section 2.13 of the Indenture  are met, \\nincluding with respect to any suc h additional issuance pursuant to clause (i), (1) the Collateral Manager consents to \\nsuch issuance  and (2) other than in the case of a Risk Retention Issuance, such issuance is approved by a Majority of \\nthe Preferred Shares. No assurance can be given that the issuance of additional securities having different interest rates than existing Classes of Notes may not adversely affect the holders of any Class of Notes. The use of such issuance \\nproceeds as Principal Collections may have the effect of causing a Par  Coverage Test that was otherwise failing to be \\ncured or to modify the effect of events that would otherwise give rise to an Event of Default and permit the Controlling \\nClass to exercise remedies under the Indenture.  \\nFuture actions of the Rating Agency and other NRSROs can adversely affect the market value or liquidity of the \\nNotes . \\nThe Rating Agency may change its published ratings criteria or methodologies for securities such as the \\nNotes at any time in the future. Further, the Rating Agency may retroacti vely apply any such new standards to the \\nratings of the Notes.  Any such action could result in a substantial lowering, suspension or withdrawal of any rating \\nassigned to any Note, despite the fact that such Note might still be performing fully to the spec ifications set forth for \\nsuch Note in this Offering Circular and the related transaction documents. Additionally, the Rating Agency may, at \\nany time and without any change in its published ratings criteria or methodology, lower, suspend or withdraw any \\nrating assigned by it to any class of Notes. If any rating initially assigned to any Note is subsequently lowered, \\nsuspended or withdrawn for any reason, Holders of the Notes may not be able to resell their Notes without a substantial discount.  \\nProbability of  default credit ratings; below investment- grade Portfolio Assets involve particular risks . \\nThe Portfolio  Asset Issuers of the Portfolio Assets will not be publicly rated as of the Closing Date. Instead, \\nMoody’ s RiskCalc will be used to assign a default probability rating pursuant to Moody’ s then current methodology \\n(“Moody’ s Default Probability Rating ”) to each Portfolio Asset for purposes of calculating the Moody ’s Weighted \\nAverage Rating Factor of the portfolio of Portfolio Assets. The assessment of the risk that such a Portfolio Asset Issuer will, within the next five years, be unable to meet any of its payment obligations within 90 days after such obligation \\nfalls due ( “probability of default ”) genera ted by Moody’ s RiskCalc is derived from a statistical analysis that relies in \\npart on financial statements of such Portfolio Asset Issuer that have been provided to Moody’ s. It does not include \\n \\n29 any qualitative assessment of the Portfolio Asset Issuers such  as the market position of its products and services, its \\ncompetitive position or the quality of its management. Furthermore, Moody ’s RiskCalc does not take into account, on \\nan individual Portfolio Asset Issuer basis, particular risk- enhancing circumstances, such as the Portfolio Asset Issuer \\nforming part of a group of companies. The statistical analysis involves only a comparison of the financial data provided \\nto Moody ’s by such Portfolio Asset Issuer against benchmark financial ratios  generated by Moody’ s RiskCalc on the \\nbasis of a database of historical financial information of a large number of companies. The Moody’ s Default \\nProbability Ratings derived from Moody ’s RiskCalc are therefore not comparable to public ratings of issuers assigned \\nby Moody’ s. \\nThe Moody ’s Default Probability Ratings assigned using Moody ’s RiskCalc are based in part on financial \\nstatement data of the Portfolio Asset Issuers of the Portfolio Assets that have been provided to Moody’ s. The financial \\nstatement data of such Portfolio As set Issuers provided to Moody ’s have not and will not be independently reviewed \\nby any other  party, and none of the parties gives any statement as to the accuracy of such financial statement data. \\nMoreover, there can be no assurance that the actual probabi lity of some or all of the Portfolio Asset Issuers of the \\nPortfolio Assets becoming unable to meet their payment obligations prior to the full repayment of the Notes is not higher than is implied by the Moody’ s Default Probability Rating derived from Moody’ s RiskCalc.  \\nIt is anticipated that the  Portfolio Assets will be subject to greater risks than publicly rated investment grade \\ncorporate obligations. Prices of the Portfolio Assets may be volatile, and will generally fluctuate due to a variety of \\nfactors t hat are inherently difficult to predict, including but not limited to, changes in interest rates, prevailing credit \\nspreads, general economic conditions, financial market conditions, domestic and international economic or political \\nevents, developments or trends in any particular industry, and the financial condition of the Portfolio Asset Issuers.  \\nAlso, under Rule 17g- 5 promulgated under the Exchange Act, nationally recognized statistical rating \\norganizations ( “NRSROs ”) not currently rating the Notes will be able to have access to the information that the \\nCo-Issuers have provided to the Rating Agency to allow it to rate, or undertake credit rating surveillance on, the Notes. \\nAny NRSRO accessing such information may, in its sole discretion, pr ovide an unsolicited rating on any of the Notes. \\nThere can be no assurance that any such unsolicited rating assigned by an NRSRO (other than the Rating Agency) on \\nany of the Notes will not be lower than the ratings of such Notes then assigned by the Rating Agency, and any such \\nunsolicited rating may be lowered, suspended or withdrawn at any time. If such unsolicited rating is lower than the \\nratings then assigned by the Rating Agency, the market value of such Notes may be adversely affected and the liquidity  \\nof such Notes may be significantly reduced.  \\nHedge Agreements are not permitted . \\nThe Issuer is not permitted to enter into hedge agreements. This may prevent the Issuer from hedging certain \\ninterest rate risks and exposure the Issuer to interest rate mismatches or other adverse outcomes.  \\nRating Agency Confirmation.  \\nHistorically, many actions by issuers of collateralized debt obligation vehicles (including, but not limited to, \\nissuing additional securities and amending relevant agreements) have been conditioned on receipt of confirmation \\nfrom the applicable rating agencies that such action would not cause the ratings on the applicable securities to be \\nreduced or withdrawn. Recently, certain rating agencies have changed the manner and the circumstances un der which \\nthey are willing to provide such confirmation and have indicated reluctance to provide confirmation in the future, \\nregardless of the requirements of the applicable indenture and other transaction documents. If the transaction \\ndocuments relating t o the Notes require that Rating Agency Confirmation is obtained before certain action may be \\ntaken and the Rating Agency is unwilling to confirm such satisfaction, it may be impossible to effect such action, \\nwhich could result in losses being realized by t he Issuer and, indirectly, by holders of Notes.  In addition, because the \\npurchase of additional Portfolio Assets with APAI Security Sales Proceeds and/or Prepayment Security Proceeds is conditional, among other things, on Rating Agency Confirmation, if the  Rating Agency is unwilling to confirm such  \\nsatisfaction in connection with a proposed purchase of a Portfolio Asset with  such APAI Security Sales Proceeds  or \\nPrepayment Security Proceeds , the Issuer will not be able to effect such purchase and will instead be required to pay \\nmost if not all of the APAI Security Sales Proceeds or Prepayment Security Proceeds (as applicable) as principal , \\nwhich would result in earlier repayment of  the Notes , particularly th e Class A Notes.  \\n \\n30 If the Rating Agency (a)  makes a public announcement or informs the Issuer, the Collateral Manager or the \\nTrustee that (i)  it believes that Rating Agency Confirmation is not required with respect to an action or (ii)  its practice \\nis to not  give such confirmations, or (b)  no longer constitutes the Rating Agency under the Indenture, the requirement \\nto obtain Rating Agency Confirmation with respect to the Rating Agency will not apply. There can be no assurance \\nthat the Rating Agency will not s ubsequently withdraw or downgrade its ratings on one or more Classes of Notes as \\na result of such actions, and any such withdrawal or downgrade could adversely affect the value or liquidity of the Notes.  \\nLimited Liquidity of Notes; Restrictions on Transfer ; Non -Petition . \\nThere is no market for any of the Notes being offered hereby and, as a result, a purchaser must be prepared \\nto hold the Notes for an indefinite period of time or until the maturity thereof. The Notes will be owned by a relatively \\nsmall numb er of investors and it is unlikely that an active secondary market for the Notes will develop. None  of the \\nInitial Purchaser s or the Placement Agent are under any obligation to make such a market, and if any Initial Purchaser  \\nor Placement Agent does make s uch a market, they may discontinue any market -making activities with respect to the \\nNotes at any time without notice. In addition, market -making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the \\nSecurities Act and the Exchange Act. Furthermore, during the recent financial crisis , securities issued in securitization \\ntransactions experienced historically high volatility and significant fluctuations in market value. Additionally, following the financial crisis, some potential buyers of such securities view  securitization products as an inappropriate \\ninvestment, thereby reducing the number of potential buyers and/or potentially affecting liquidity in the secondary \\nmarket. Accordingly, no assurances can be made as to the liquidity of or the trading market for  the Notes. Purchasers \\nof the Notes may find it difficult or uneconomic to liquidate their investment at any particular time. Defaults or \\ndeferrals of interest with respect to the Portfolio Assets may negatively impact the liquidity of or the trading marke t \\nfor the Notes. The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or under any U.S. state securities or “ Blue Sky”  laws or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and are being issued and sold in reliance \\nupon exemptions fr om registration provided by such laws.  \\nNo Note  may be sold or transferred unless such sale or transfer (i) is exempt from the registration \\nrequirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, (ii) will not constitute or result in a non -exempt \\n“prohibited transaction ” under ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (or a violation of any Similar Law), (iii)  does not \\ncause either of the Co -Issuers to become subject to the regulatory requirements of the Investment Company Act, and \\n(iv) is made to (a) except for the Class C  Notes  (which may only be sold or transferred to U.S. Persons), a non-U.S. \\nPerson in a transaction outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S or (b) a U.S. Person that is both a \\n“qualified purchaser ” (for purposes of the Investment Company Act) and a “ qualified institutional buyer ” (as defined \\nin Rule 144A under the Securities Act). Prospective transferees of Certificated Notes will be required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture to deliver a certificate to the Trustee and the Co -Issuers relating to  compliance with the \\nSecurities Act, applicable state securities laws, ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and the Investment Company Act \\nand transferees of beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note or Regulation S Global Note will be deemed to have made  certain representations set forth in the Indenture and described herein. The Co- Issuers will not provide \\nregistration rights to any purchaser of the Note s and none of the Co- Issuers, the Trustee, or any other person may \\nregister the Note s under the Securi ties Act or any state securities or “ Blue Sky”  laws.  \\nThe Notes are subject to early redemption by Optional Redemption by Liquidation, Optional Redemption by Refinancing and Global Clean -Up Call   \\nOptional Redemption by Liquidation.  \\nThe Notes may be optional ly redeemed in whole but not in part, by the Co- Issuers or the Issuer, as applicable, \\nat the applicable Redemption Prices with any available funds (i) on any Business Day (which will be the related Redemption Date) after the Non -Call Period, or (ii) upon t he occurrence of a Tax Event, on any Payment Date during \\nor after the Non -Call Period, in either case, at the direction of the Collateral Manager ; provided that if a Supermajority \\nof the Preferred Shareholders obj ects to such redemption within 2 Business D ays of notice thereof, such redemption \\nshall be subject to the consent of the Supermajority of the Preferred Shareholders.   See Section 9.5 of the Indenture.  \\nOptional Redemption by Refinancing.  \\n \\n31 On any Business Day after the Non- Call Period, the Collateral Manager  may direct that a redemption of one \\nor more (including all) Classes of Notes occur by an Optional Redemption by Refinancing; provided that if a \\nSupermajority of the Preferred Shareholders objects to any Optional Redemption by Refinancing within 2 B usiness \\nDays of notice thereof, such Optional Redemption by Refinancing shall be subject to the consent of the Supermajority \\nof the Preferred Shareholders . A more junior Class of Notes may be fully redeemed in connection with an Optional \\nRedemption by Refi nancing even if a more senior Class of Notes remains outstanding.   See Section 9.3 of the \\nIndenture.  \\nGlobal Clean -Up Call . \\nAt the written direction of the Collateral Manager to the Issuer, the Preferred Shares Paying Agent and the \\nTrustee, with copies to the Rating Agency, not later than 20 days prior to the proposed redemption date, the Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer, in whole but not in part, at the redemption price therefor, on any Business Day \\nafter the Non -Call Period on w hich the aggregate Principal Balance of the Portfolio As sets is equal to or less than 20 % \\nof the Effective Date Balance. Any Global Clean -Up Call  is subject to the sale of the Portfolio Assets for the Global \\nClean -Up Call  Redemption Price.   See Section 9.6  of the Indenture.  \\nIn the event of an early redemption, including by Optional Redemption by Liquidation, Optional Redemption \\nby Refinancing or Global Clean -Up Call , the holders of the Notes will be repaid prior to their Stated Maturity Dates.  \\nAny such redemption may result in a shorter term investment than an investor in Notes may have anticipated and there is no assurance that holders will find suitable investments with comparable yields, maturity or credit profile in which \\nto invest the proceeds.  \\nIn addition, an Optional Redemption by Liquidation could require the Collateral Manager to liquidate \\npositions more rapidly than would otherwise be desirable, which could adversely affect the realized value of the Portfolio Assets sold.  \\nStated Maturity Date, Ave rage Life and prepayment or optional redemption c onsiderations ; APAI Securities  and \\nPrepayment Security Proceeds . \\nThe Stated Maturity Date of each Class of Notes is the Payment Date occurring in July 2035. Because the \\nBank Subordinated Note s mature before the Stated Maturity Date  and the Portfolio Assets may prepay under certain \\ncircumstances, the average life of the Class A Notes  is expected to be, and the average lives of the other Note s may \\nbe, shorter than the number of years until the Stated Maturity D ate. See “ Risk Factors— Risks Relating to the Notes —\\nThe Notes are subject to early redemption by Optional Redemption by Liquidation, Optional Redemption by \\nRefinancing and Global Clean -Up Call ” and “Risk Factors —Risks Relating to the Portfolio Assets —Option al \\nRedemptions and Prepayments of the Portfolio Assets. ”  \\nCoverage Prepayments will be made on certain Notes if any Par Coverage Test is not satisfied as of any  \\nCalculation Date, which may occur, for example, if defaults occur with respect to the Portfolio Assets.   \\nThe Holders of the Notes will have no control over whether a Portfolio Asset is sold. The sale of any Portfolio \\nAsset may result in the remaining portfolio of Portfolio Assets having a greater concentration of risk due  to the smaller \\nnumber of issuers of Portfolio Assets represented in the portfolio causing a possible decrease in regional diversity or \\na lower overall credit quality, which could have a material adverse effect on the Notes.  Significant principal payments \\non the Notes could be made  on Payment Dates prior to the Stated Maturity  Date as result of sales of Portfolio Assets.  \\nIn addition, significant principal payments on the Notes could be made on Payment Dates prior to the Stated \\nMaturity Date  due to the existence of Portfolio Assets w ith maturity dates earlier than the Stated Maturity Date .  \\nMarket developments may increase the likelihood that issuers of Portfolio Assets  elect to prepay such securities prior \\nto their maturity date to the extent permitted. Such prepayments will be distr ibuted in accordance with the Priority of \\nPayments and will result in prepayments of the Notes  except to the extent reinvested in additional Portfolio Assets in \\naccordance with the Indenture as described in “ Security for the Notes —Activities of Collateral Manager with respect \\nto Portfolio Assets and Eligible Investments ”. \\n \\n32 The Holders of the Notes will have no control over the timing or amount of any prepayment or optional \\nredemptions on the Portfolio Assets . Prepayment or optional redemptions and repayments  at maturity of the Portfolio \\nAssets may result in the remaining portfolio of Portfolio Assets having a greater concentration of risk due to the \\nsmaller number of issuers of Portfolio Assets represented in the portfolio causing a possible decrease in regional \\ndiversity or a lower overall credit quality, which could have a material adverse effect on the Notes.    \\nIn addition, Portfolio Assets that become APAI Securities may be sold by the Collateral Manage r. The \\nHolders of the Notes will have no control over whether a Portfolio Asset becomes an APAI Security. The Collateral Manager may use some or all of the related APAI Security Sales Proceeds  and any Prepayment Security Proceeds to \\npurchase additional Portfolio Assets as described in “ Security for the Notes —Activities of Collateral Manager with \\nrespect to Portfolio Assets and Eligible Investments ”.   \\nThe Holders of the Notes will have no control over whether any or all of the APAI Security Sale s Proceeds  \\nor Prepayment Security Proceeds are used to purchase additional Portfolio Assets. P urchases of additiona l Portfolio \\nAssets may result in the portfolio of Portfolio Assets having a greater concentration of risk, a decrease in regional \\ndiversity or a lower overall credit quality, which could have a material adverse effect on the Notes.  To the extent the \\nCollateral Manager chooses not to or is unable to purchase additional Portfolio Assets with APAI Security Sales \\nProceeds  or Prepayment Security Proceeds (for example, due to market conditions, the unavailability of suitable \\nobligations or an inability to satisfy the Reinvestment Criteria ), an amount equal to at least the lesser of the amount of \\nsuch Unapplied Proceeds  and the Required Principal Collection s Depo sit portion thereof  shall be designated by the \\nCollateral Manager on the applicable Reinvestment Cut -Off Date  (or if such date is not a Business Day, the next \\nfollowing Business Day) as P rincipal Collections and, to the extent there are any remaining  Unapplied Proceeds  in \\nexcess thereof , the Collateral Manager may designate out of such remaining proceeds up to the lesser of the amount \\nof such remaining proceeds and an amount equal to the Maximum Interest Allocation as Interest Collections  (and any \\nremaining excess as Principal Collections) on the applicable Reinvestment Cut -Off Date  (or if such date is not a \\nBusiness Day, the next following Business Day) , which designations will result in prepayments of the Notes .    \\nInterest Rate Risk.   \\nThe index used to compute the interest rate on each Class of Notes during such period as such Class pays a \\nfloating -rate of interest will be a SOFR -based rate.  The publication of SOFR began in April 2018, and, therefore, it \\nhas a lim ited history. In addition, the future performance of SOFR cannot be predicted based on the limited historical \\nperformance. Future levels of SOFR may bear little or no relation to the historical actual or historical indicative SOFR \\ndata. Prior observed patt erns, if any, in the behavior of market variables and their relation to SOFR, such as \\ncorrelations, may change in the future. While some pre- publication historical data has been released by the Federal \\nReserve Bank of New York ( “FRBNY” ), production of such historical indicative SOFR data inherently involves \\nassumptions, estimates and approximations. No future performance of SOFR may be inferred from any of the \\nhistorical actual or historical indicative SOFR data. Hypothetical or historical performance data are not indicative of, \\nand have no bearing on, the potential performance of SOFR.  \\nSince the initial publication of SOFR, daily changes in the rate have, on occasion, been more volatile than \\ndaily changes in other benchma rk or market rates, such as USD LIBOR, during corresponding periods. In addition, \\nalthough changes in term SOFR and compounded SOFR generally are not expected to be as volatile as changes in \\nSOFR on a daily basis, the return on, value of and market for the  Notes may fluctuate more than floating rate debt \\nsecurities with interest rates based on less volatile rates.  \\nAccording to the Alternate Reference Rates Committee ( “ARRC” ), SOFR was developed for use in certain \\nU.S. dollar derivatives and other financial contracts as an alternative to USD LIBOR in part because it is considered a good representation of general funding conditions in the overnight U.S. Treasury repurchase agreement market. \\nHowever, as a rate based on transactions secured by U.S. Treasury securities, it does not measure bank -specific credit \\nrisk and, as a result, is less likely to correlate with the unsecured short -term funding costs of banks. This may mean \\nthat market participants would not consider SOFR a suitable substitute, replacement or successor for all of the purposes \\nfor which USD LIBOR historically has been used (including, without limitation, as a representation of the unsecured \\nshort -term funding costs of banks), which may, in turn, lessen market acceptance of SOFR. Any failure of SOFR to \\ngain market acceptance could adversely affect the return on and value of Notes and the price at which investors can sell such Notes in the secondary market.  \\n \\n33 If SOFR does not prove to be widely used as a benchmark in securities that are s imilar or comparable to the \\nNotes, the value of the Notes (and price of the Notes in any secondary sales) may be lower than those of debt securities \\nwith interest rates based on rates that are more widely used. Similarly, market terms for debt securities w ith interest \\nrates based on SOFR, including, but not limited to, the spread over the reference rate reflected in the interest rate \\nprovisions or manner of compounding the reference rate, may evolve over time, and as a result, the value of the Notes \\n(and pr ice of the  Notes in any secondary sales) may be lower than those of later -issued debt securities. Investors in \\nthe Notes may not be able to sell such Notes at all or may not be able to sell such Notes at prices that will provide \\nthem with a yield comparabl e to similar investments that have a developed secondary market, and may consequently \\nsuffer from increased pricing volatility and market risk.  \\nIn addition, there currently is no uniform market convention with respect to the implementation of SOFR as \\na bas e rate for floating -rate notes or other securities. The manner of calculation and related conventions with respect \\nto the determination of interest rates based on SOFR in floating -rate notes markets may differ materially compared \\nwith the manner of calculation and related conventions with respect to the determination of interest rates based on SOFR in other markets, such as the derivatives and loan markets. Investors should carefully consider how any potential \\ninconsistencies between the manner of calculati on and related conventions with respect to the determination of interest \\nrates based on SOFR across these markets may impact any hedging or other financial arrangements which they may \\nput in place in connection with any acquisition, holding or disposition of the Notes.  \\nSOFR is a relatively new rate, and the FRBNY (or a successor), as administrator of SOFR, may make \\nmethodological or other changes that could change the value of SOFR, including changes related to the method by which SOFR is calculated, eligib ility criteria applicable to the transactions used to calculate SOFR, or timing related \\nto the publication of SOFR. If the manner in which SOFR is calculated is changed, that change may result in a \\nreduction of the amount of interest payable on the SOFR notes, which may adversely affect the trading prices of the \\nSOFR notes. The administrator of SOFR may withdraw, modify, amend, suspend or discontinue the calculation or dissemination of SOFR in its sole discretion and without notice and has no obligation to consider the interests of \\nholders of the SOFR notes in calculating, withdrawing, modifying, amending, suspending or discontinuing SOFR. For \\npurposes of the formula used to calculate interest with respect to the Notes, SOFR in respect of a particular date w ill \\nnot be adjusted for any modifications or amendments to SOFR data that the administrator of SOFR may publish after \\nthe interest rate on the Notes for that day has been determined in accordance with the terms and provisions set forth \\nin the Indenture.  \\nUpon the occurrence of certain events, an alternative base rate may be selected to replace SOFR as the \\nReference Rate in relation to the Notes, in accordance with the requirements of the Indenture. However, there can be \\nno assurance that (a) any such alternative base rate will effectively mitigate interest rate risks or result in an equivalent \\nmethodology for determining the interest rates on the Notes, (b) any such alternative base rate will apply prior to any \\ndate on which the Issuer suffers adverse consequences from the elimination or modification or potential elimination \\nor modification of SOFR or (c) any such alternative base rate will not have a material adverse effect on the holders of \\nany Class of Notes, including the liquidity of such Notes.  Any such change to an alternative base rate could have a \\nmaterial adverse effect on one or more Classes of Notes, including by affecting the market value or liquidity of such \\nNotes.  \\nProjections, forecasts and estimates are forward looking statements and are inhere ntly uncertain . \\nEstimates of the average lives of the Notes, together with any projections, forecasts and estimates provided \\nto prospective purchasers of the Notes, are forward- looking statements.  Projections are necessarily speculative in \\nnature, and it should be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the projections will not materialize \\nor will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, actual results will vary from the projections, and such \\nvariations may be material. Some imp ortant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in \\nany forward- looking statements include changes in interest rates, exchange rates and default and recovery rates; \\nmarket, financial or legal uncertainties; mismatches between the time of accrual and receipt of Interest Collections \\nfrom the Portfolio Assets. None of the Co- Issuers, the Initial Purchaser s, the Placement Agent, the Collateral Manager, \\nthe Trustee, the Collateral Administrator or any other party to this transaction  or any of their respective Affiliates has \\nany obligation to update or otherwise revise any projections, forecasts or estimates, including any revisions to reflect changes in economic conditions or other circumstances arising after the date of this Offering Circular or to reflect the \\noccurrence of unanticipated events.  \\n \\n34 The Issuer is recently formed and has a limited operating history; the Co- Issuer has no operating history and has \\nno assets; and each of the Issuer and the Co- Issuer is limited in its permitted activities.  \\nThe Issuer is a recently formed entity and has little prior operating history or prior business experience. The \\nIssuer will have no significant assets other than the Portfolio Assets and the Accounts, which, in each case, will be \\npledged to secure the Notes. The Issuer will not engage in any business activity other than the issuance of the Notes \\nand Preferred Shares as described herein, the acquisition and sale of Portfolio Assets, certain activities conducted in \\nconnection with the payment of amounts in respect of the Notes and Preferred Shares and other activities incidental \\nto the foregoing. The Issuer is an exempted company with limited liability incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands and all of its directors reside in the Caym an Islands. Because the Issuer is a Cayman Islands company, it may \\nnot be possible for investors to enforce against the Issuer in United States courts judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the United States securities laws.  \\nThe Co -Issuer is a recently formed entity and has no prior operating history or prior business experience. The \\nCo-Issuer does not have and will not have any assets. The Co- Issuer will not engage in any business activity other \\nthan the co -issuance of the Notes.  \\nThe I ssuer is subject to the risk of third party litigation and has limited funds available . \\nThe Issuer ’s investment activities may subject it to the risks of becoming involved in litigation by third \\nparties. This risk may be greater where the Issuer exercises control or significant influence over a company’ s direction. \\nThe expense of defending against claims against the Issuer by third parties and paying any amounts pursuant to \\nsettlements or judgments would be borne by the Issuer and would reduce the amounts a vailable for distribution to \\nholders of the Notes and on the Issuer ’s net assets. The funds available to the Issuer to pay certain fees and expenses \\nof the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the Administrator and any Blocker Subsidiaries and for payment of the Issuer ’s other accrued and unpaid Administrative Expenses are limited as described in Article XI of the Indenture . In \\nthe event that such funds are not sufficient to pay the expenses incurred by the Issuer, the ability of the Issuer to \\noperate eff ectively may be impaired, and the Issuer may not be able to defend or prosecute legal proceedings that may \\nbe brought against it or that the Issuer might otherwise bring to protect its interests. In addition, service providers who \\nare not paid in full, inc luding the Administrator which provides the directors to the Issuer, have the right to resign. \\nThis could lead to the Issuer being in default under the Cayman Islands Companies Law (as amended) and potentially being struck from the Cayman Islands companies  register and dissolved.  \\nThe Issuer and/or payments on the Notes may be subject to various U.S. and other taxes . \\nAn investment in the Notes involves complex tax issues. See “ Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax \\nConsiderations ” for a more detailed discussion of certain tax issues raised by an investment in the Notes.  \\nThe Issuer expects to conduct its affairs so that it should not be treated as engaged in a trade or business \\nwithin the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes (including as a result of the manner in which it acquires, holds, and disposes of its assets). Although the Issuer does not expect to be treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business or to be deriving income effectively connected therewith, if the Issuer were found to be engaged in a trade \\nor business within the United States and had income effectively connected therewith, interest paid on the Notes to a \\nnon-U.S. holder would nevertheless not be expected to be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax (assuming certain \\nform delivery re quirements are complied with), although such a withholding tax could be imposed as a result of \\nunanticipated activities, changes in law, contrary conclusions by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS ”), or \\nother causes , in which case the Issuer, as a withholding agent, could be liable for failure to withhold such tax. Further, \\nnon-U.S. holders that are investors in any Class of Notes that are recharacterized as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal \\nincome tax purposes could be subject to U.S. federal net income taxes , which the Issuer would be required to withhold \\nnotwithstanding that the Issuer does not currently intend to make any such withholding (which could result in a shortfall of available funds to make payments on the Notes if a  determination that the Issuer is engaged in a trade or \\nbusiness is not made until a date in the future) . In order to eliminate the risk that any such withholding tax could be \\nimposed on the Issuer, all investors in the Preferred Shares and Issuer -Only Not es are required to be United States \\npersons within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (“ United States persons ”).   \\n \\n35 If the Issuer is treated as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation and is found to be both engaged \\nin a trade or business in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes and deriving income effectively \\nconnected therewith, the Issuer could be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at normal corporate \\ntax rates (and possibly a 30% branch profits tax) and payments on the Notes may become subject to a 30% withholding \\ntax. The imposition of such taxes would materially affect the Issuer ’s financial ability to make payments on the Notes.  \\nIn addition, if the Issuer wer e to be taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it would likely be a \\npassive foreign investment company (a “ PFIC ”) and a controlled foreign corporation (a “ CFC” ) for U.S. federal \\nincome tax purposes. In this case, a U.S. holder of Notes that are recharacterized as equity in the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be subject to adverse tax consequences.  \\nAlthough the Issuer does not intend to be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to its net income, \\nincome derived by the Issuer may be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax. A ssuming  compliance with the transfer \\nrestrictions requiring that all Preferred Shares and Class C Notes be beneficially owned by U nited States p ersons, and \\nassuming  that certain transfer restrictions and documentation delivery requirements are complied with and are \\nadequate to prevent the Issuer from constituting a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal \\nincome tax purposes, under current law, income derived by the Issuer in respect of Portfolio Assets is not expected to \\nbe subject to U.S. federal withholding tax. However, income derived by the Issuer in respect of the Portfolio Assets \\ncould become subject to withholding or gross income taxes as a result of a change in applicable law, treaty, rule or \\nregulation or interpretation thereof, possibly with retroactive effect. In that case, there can be no assurance that \\namounts available, after withholding or gross income taxes, would be sufficie nt to make payments of interest and \\nprincipal on the Notes.  \\nSee “Certain  U.S. Federal  Income Tax Considerations ” below, for a more detailed discussion of certain \\nwithholding tax issues raised by an investment in the Notes.  \\nNo Gross- Up.  \\nAll payments on the Notes will be made without any deduction or withholding for or on account of any taxes \\nof any nature whatsoever unless such deduction or withholding is required by any applicable law, including in connection with FATC A, as modified by the practice of any relevant governmental revenue authority, then in effect. \\nIf the Issuer is so required to deduct or withhold, then no such person will be obligated to pay any additional amounts in respect of such withholding or deduction.  \\nHolders may be subj ect to withholding or forced sale for failure to provide certain tax information.  \\nUnder FATCA, the Issuer may be subject to a 30% withholding tax on certain income and on the gross \\nproceeds from the sale, maturity, or other disposition of certain of its as sets, although proposed Treasury regulations  \\n(the “ Proposed FATCA Regulations ”), which may currently be relied upon by taxpayers until final Treasury \\nregulations are published, eliminate such withholding on gross proceeds . Under an intergovernmental agreement \\nentered into between the United States and the Cayman Islands, the Issuer will not be subject to withholding under FATCA if it complies with the Cayman FATCA Legislation, which requires the Issuer to provide the name,  address, \\nand taxpayer identification number of, and certain other information with respect to, certain holders of Notes to the \\nTax Information Authority of the Cayman Islands, which would then provide this information to the IRS. There can \\nbe no assurance  that the Issuer will be able to comply with the Cayman FATCA Legislation. In addition, FATCA \\ncould be amended to require the Issuer to withhold on “ foreign passthru payments ” to holders that fail to provide \\ncertain information to the Issuer or are “ foreig n financial institutions ” that do not comply with FATC A, provided that \\nsuch payments are made on or after the date of (or, under the Proposed FATCA Regulations, the date that is two years after the date of) publication in the Federal Register of final Trea sury regulations defining the term “foreign passthru \\npayment.” Under a grandfathering rule, however, no such withholding under FATCA will be required on payments made in respect of Notes that are properly treated as indebtedness for U.S. federal income tax  purposes, unless those \\nNotes are materially modified on or after the date that is six months after the date of publication of final Treasury \\nregulations defining the term “foreign passthru payment.”  \\nIf an investor fails to provide the Issuer or its agent s with any correct, complete and accurate information or \\ndocumentation that may be required for the Issuer to comply with FATCA, the Cayman FATCA Legislation and to prevent the imposition of U.S. federal withholding tax under FATCA on payments to or for the benefit of the Issuer, \\n \\n36 or if the investor ’s ownership of any Notes would otherwise cause the Issuer to be subject to any tax under FATCA, \\nthe Issuer (and any agent acting on its behalf) is authorized to withhold amounts otherwise distributable to the investor, \\nto compel the investor to sell its Notes, and, if the investor does not sell its Notes within 10 Business Days after notice \\nfrom the Issuer, to sell the investor ’s Notes on behalf of the investor.  \\nOECD Common Reporting Standard.  \\nThe Cayman Islands has also signed, along with over 80 other countries, a multilateral competent authority \\nagreement to implement the OECD Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information –  Common \\nReporting Standard (the “ CRS ”), which requires “ Financial Institutions ” such as the Issuer to identify, and report \\ninformation in respect of, specified persons in the jurisdictions which sign and implement the CRS and to adopt and \\nimplement written policies and procedures setting out how it will address its obligations under the CRS.  \\nThe Issuer may form Blocker Subsidiaries that would be subject to tax . \\nTo reduce the risk that the Issuer will be engaged in a trade or business within the United States for U.S. \\nfederal income tax purposes, in certain circumstances set forth in t he Indenture, certain Portfolio Assets may be \\ntransferred to one or more Blocker Subsidiaries wholly owned by the Issuer that will be treated as either U.S. or foreign \\ncorporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Any foreign Blocker Subsidiary may be  treated as engaged in a \\ntrade or business within the United States , may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at normal \\ncorporate tax rates  (and possibly a 30% branch profits tax) , may file U.S. tax returns and reports, and/or may be  subject \\nto a 30% U.S. withholding tax on some or all of its income. In the case of a U.S. Blocker Subsidiary, the Blocker \\nSubsidiary would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at normal corporate tax rates, and would \\nbe required to file U.S. tax returns and reports. In addition, distributions from a U.S. Blocker Subsidiary, or a foreign \\nBlocker Subsidi ary that is engaged in a trade or business within the United States, to the Issuer may be subject to a \\n30% U.S. withholding tax. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding their consequences if the \\nIssuer organizes a Blocker Subsidiary.  U.S. holders of Notes that are recharacterized as equity for U.S. federal income \\ntax purposes will not be permitted to use losses recognized by the Blocker Subsidiary to offset gains recognized by the Issuer and may be subject to the adverse PFIC or CFC rules with respect to the Blocker Subsidiary. Additionally, \\nthe existence of both a U.S. Blocker Subsidiary and a non- U.S. Blocker S ubsidiary may cause the non- U.S. Blocker \\nSubsidiary to be treated as a CFC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The implementation of this rule is uncertain \\nat this point and investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the consequences thereof.  \\nReplacement of SOFR . \\nIf an alternative base rate is designat ed to replace SOFR as the Reference Rate in relation to the Notes, the \\nU.S. federal income tax consequences of such a replacement are uncertain.  If such a replacement constituted a \\n“significant m odification” of the Notes under Treasury Regulation section 1.1001 -3, the replacement may result in a \\ndeemed taxable exchange of the Notes and the realization of gain or loss, as well as other corollary tax consequences. \\nProspective investors should consul t their tax advisors with respect to the consequences of the designation of an \\nalternative base rate in place of SOFR.  \\nRisks Related to Banks, Thrifts and the Banking Industry  \\nGeneral . \\nPayments under the Portfolio Assets, and in turn under the Notes, are highly dependent upon payments \\nreceived from the Portfolio Asset Issuers. As such, the ability of the Co -Issuers to make payments under the Notes, as \\nwell as the credit ratings of Notes, may be adversely affected by the performance and earnings of , and def aults and \\ndeferrals by , such entities. Furthermore, adverse developments with respect to the banking and thrift industry in \\ngeneral may adversely affect the ability of the Co -Issuers to make payments under the Notes and may also adversely \\naffect the rating , market value and/or liquidity of the Notes.  \\n \\n37 Bank institutions are heavily regulated and further restrictive regulation may reduce the profitability and growth \\nof bank institutions, which may adversely affect the ability of the Issuer and Co -Issuer to mak e payments under \\nthe Notes . \\nThe federal banking agenc y rules implementing the Basel III international capital framework (the “Basel III \\nRule s”) apply to all depository institutions and to top- tier bank holding companies and top- tier savings and loan \\nholding companies with total consolidated assets of at least U.S. $1 billion, and thus applies to some or all of the Portfolio Asset Issuers  of the Portfolio Assets . In general, the Basel III Rules  require subject institutions to hold a \\ngreater level of Tier 1 (core) and Tier 2 (supplemental) capital by increasing certain minimum capital requirements and capital ratios, and requiring greater amounts of capital to of fset the ownership of assets that are delinquent or are \\nsecured by certain types of collateral, including certain commercial real estate. The amount of Tier 2 capital held by \\na banking institution (such as the  Bank  Subordinated Note s included in the Issuer ’s investment portfolio ), however, is \\nnot limited to the amount of Tier 1 capital included in total capital. T he Basel III Rule s also  require certain additional \\ndeductions from capital if certain types of assets (e.g., mortgage servicing rights, certain de ferred tax assets and \\ncommon stock in unconsolidated financial institutions) are above certain levels. As a result of these changes, subject \\nbanking organizations have been required to make certain changes to their asset portfolios and general business practices over time, which may have an impact on the overall performance of such institutions, including the Portfolio \\nAsset Issuers of the Portfolio Assets . \\nIn the event that any Portfolio Asset Issuer  falls below certain of these capital adequacy standards,  it may \\nbecome subject to “ prompt corrective action ”, a regulatory framework that confers on the federal bank supervisory \\nagencies increasing powers to place restrictions (including restrictions on the payment of a bank’s obligations) on the \\nactivities of banks that failed to meet required regulatory capital standards, depending on the extent to which a bank \\nfalls below those standards. If a bank becomes critically undercapitalized, a bank may be  placed into a United States \\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corpora tion (the “FDIC ”) administered receivership or conservatorship. The effect of \\ninadequate capital can have a potentially adverse consequence on any Portfolio Asset Issuer ’s financial condition, its \\nability to operate as a going concern and its ab ility to operate as a regulated financial institution, and may have a \\nmaterial adverse impact on the ability of the Issuer to collect on any  related Portfolio Asset.  \\nMore generally, federally -chartered and state- chartered commercial banks are subject to co mprehensive \\nregulation and supervision by their primary federal financial regulatory agencies, and in the case of state -chartered \\ninstitutions, by their primary state financial regulatory agencies. Federal and state regulatory agencies have broad \\nauthority  to place restrictions on the activities of banks under the regulation and supervision for variety of reasons, \\nincluding unsafe and unsound banking practices, violations of law, and other managerial and operational deficiencies. FDIC -insured banks that are  in default or are in danger of default may be placed into receivership (and in rare cases, \\nconservatorship), with the FDIC assuming control of the bank as receiver or conservator. The FDIC ’s \\nreceivership/conservatorship powers are broad, and include the authority to disaffirm or repudiate contracts to which the bank is a party if in so doing, such action would aid in the FDIC ’s administration of the bank’ s estate. As a result \\nof this authority, there is a risk that the FDIC could repudiate or disaffirm a P ortfolio Asset Issuer’s payment \\nobligations upon which the Issuer relies in making payments under the Notes.  \\nFurthermore, no assurance can be given that the U.S. federal government or any U.S. regulatory body (or \\nother authority or regulatory body) will not continue to take further legislative or regulatory action, and the effect of such actions, if any, cannot be known or predicted.  \\nRisks Relating to the Portfolio Assets  \\nNature of the Bank Subordinated Note s. \\nThe obligations of any Bank Subordinated Note  Issuer under its Bank Subordinated Note s are unsecured and \\ngenerally rank subordinate and junior in right of payment to all present and future secured or unsecured Senior Indebtedness of such Bank Subordinated Note  Issuer existing now or incurred in the future. “ Senior Indebtedness ” \\ngenerally includes all obligations of the Bank Subordinated Note  Issuer with respect to any of its liabilities, except for \\n(i) liabilities to trade creditors arising in the ordinary course of business and (ii) obligations that are neither superior to nor pari passu in right of payment with the Bank Subordinated Note s. Typically, no payment of principal of or \\npremium, if any, or interest on any Bank Subordinated Note , and no redemption, exchange, retirement, purchase or \\n \\n38 other acquisition of any Bank Subordinated Note , may be made if (i) any Senior Indebtedness of the issuing Bank \\nSubordinated Note  Issuer has not been paid when due and any applicable grace period with respect to such def ault has \\nended with such default not having been cured or waived or ceasing to exist or (ii) the maturity of any Senior \\nIndebtedness of the issuing Bank Subordinated Note  Issuer has been accelerated because of a default and such \\nacceleration has not been r escinded or cancelled. In the event of the bankruptcy, liquidation or dissolution of a Bank \\nSubordinated Note  Issuer, its assets would be available to pay obligations under its Bank Subordinated Note s only \\nafter all payments have been made on its Senior In debtedness. Typically, any Bank Subordinated Note  Issuer or any \\nsubsidiary of any Bank Subordinated Note  Issuer may incur additional indebtedness, liabilities and obligations, \\nincluding Senior Indebtedness and other indebtedness ranking senior to the relat ed Bank Subordinated Note s. In \\naddition, Bank Subordinated Note  Issuers may be parties to agreements with holders of Senior Indebtedness that have \\nthe practical effect of further subordinating the rights of holders of the related Bank Subordinated Note s to such holders \\nof Senior Indebtedness under certain circumstances. The Bank Subordinated Note  Indentures or Bank Subordinated \\nNote  Purchase Agreements do not afford the Issuer , as the holder of the Bank Subordinated Note s, protection in the \\nevent of a highl y leveraged or other transaction involving the related Bank Subordinated Note  Issuer that may \\nadversely affect it. See “ Security for the Notes —Initial Portfolio Assets —Subordination. ” \\nUpon the bankruptcy, liquidation or dissolution of a Bank Subordinated N ote Issuer, and subject to the \\napplicable subordination provisions, generally the principal of and unpaid interest on the Bank Subordinated Note s of \\nsuch Bank Subordinated Note  Issuer may be accelerated by the holders of such Bank Subordinated Note s with the \\napproval of the a pplicable regulator, if required. However, holders of Bank Subordinated Note s will not have any right \\nto accelerate payment in the case of a default of prin cipal thereof or premium or interest thereon or breach in the \\nperformance of any other covenant contained in such Bank Subordinated Note s or the related Bank Subordinated Note  \\nIndenture or Bank Subordinated Note  Purchase Agreement. Furthermore, the Issuer will own less than 100% of the \\nPrincipal Balance of the Bank Subordinated Note s of certain of the individual Bank Subordinated Note  Issuers and \\ntherefore may not be able to control any matters as to which holders thereof are entitled to vote, give their consent or take action.  \\nProspective purchasers of the Notes should consider and assess for themselves the likely level of defaults, \\nthe likely level and timing of recoveries on any Bank Subordinated Note s in the Trust Estate, and the likely levels of \\ninteres t rates during the term of the Notes.  \\nThe Bank Subordinated Notes are not insured or guaranteed by any regulatory authority, any governmental \\nagency or instrumentality or any guaranty fund.  \\nThe Bank Subordinated Notes  are not deposits or other obligations of any bank institution and are not \\ninsured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other governmental agency or instrumentality.   \\nThe ability of Bank Subordinated Note I ssuers that are holding companies of banks, thrifts or other depository \\ninstitutions to pay and discharge their obligations, including payment of principal of and interest on the Bank \\nSubordinated Notes depends on the dividends paid and distributions and other payments made to such issuers by their subsidiaries and on obtaining funds from corporate borrowings or by selling their securities . \\nThe principal source of funds of a Bank Subordinated Note Issuer that is a holding company to service its \\ndebts, inclu ding its Bank Subordinated Note s, are dividends, interest, distributions and other payments from its \\nsubsidiaries. Federal and state banking regulations limit dividends from bank subsidiaries to their holding companies. Dividend limitations vary, depending  on the jurisdiction of formation of the subsidiary and state law. Generally, banks, \\nthrifts and other depository institutions are prohibited from paying dividends when doing so would cause them to fall \\nbelow regulatory minimum capital levels.  In addition , all depository institutions must maintain a capital conservation \\nbuffer which can be satisfied only with CETI (Common Equity Tier 1) capital. If a depository institution’s risk- based \\ncapital ratios were to fall below the applicable buffer levels, it would face graduated constraints on dividends, stock repurchases and other capital distributions based on the amount of the shortfall. Additionally, limits exist on banks \\nand depository institutions paying dividends in excess of net income for specified period s. Federal bank regulatory \\nagencies also have the authority to prohibit subsidiary banks from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices or \\nviolations of law in conducting their business. The payment of dividends or other transfers of funds to a holding \\ncompa ny, depending on the financial condition of the bank, could be deemed an unsafe or unsound practice. Dividend \\npayments from subsidiary banks would also be prohibited under the “prompt corrective action” regulations of the \\n \\n39 federal bank regulators if any subsidiary is, or after payment of such dividends would be, undercapitalized under such \\nregulations . \\nIn addition, subsidiary banks are subject to restrictions on transactions with affiliates under federal law that \\nlimit their ability to transfer funds or other items of value to their holding company or other non- bank affiliates, \\nwhether in the form of loans and other extensions of credit, investments and asset purchases, or as other transactions \\ninvolving the  transfer of value.   Regulatory restrictions limiting the aggregate amount of loans to, and investments in, \\nany single affiliate limit and may prevent bank holding companies from borrowing from their depository institution \\nsubsidiaries and generally require that any such borrowings be collateralized. All such legal and regulatory limitations \\nand restrictions may change at any time with respect to any bank. If consent were to be required from, and were to be \\nwithheld by, an a pplicable regulat or with respect to any matter described in this paragraph, such affiliated bank holding \\ncompany would likely exercise its rights to defer interest payments on its  Bank Subordinated Notes , and the Issuer \\nmay not have funds available to make anticipated dist ributions on the Notes during such, and in subsequent periods.  \\nA bank’ s transactions with its non -bank affiliates also are required generally to be on arm ’s-length terms. \\nAccordingly, there is no assurance that any Bank Subordinated Note Issuer that is a h olding company will receive \\ndividends or other distributions from its subsidiary banks, thrifts or other depository institution in an amount sufficient to pay interest on or principal of the Bank Subordinated Notes issued by it.  \\nThe Bank Subordinated Note s of a Bank Subordinated Note  Issuer are subordinated to such Bank Subordinated \\nNote  Issuer ’s existing and future senior debt and to the obligations of its subsidiaries . \\nThe Bank Subordinated Note s of a Bank Subordinated Note  Issuer are subordinated, unsec ured obligations \\nand, consequently, are junior in right of payment to all of such Bank Subordinated Note  Issuer ’s secured and unsecured \\nsenior debt now existing or that may be incurred in the future. As a result, if such Bank Subordinated Note  Issuer were \\nto become subject to any receivership, conservatorship, termination, winding up, liquidation or reorganization, \\nincluding as a result of any liquidation, reorganization or other insolvency proceeding under bankruptcy laws or any \\nother applicable insolvency  law (including the Federal Deposit Insurance Act), make any assignment for the benefit \\nof its creditors or otherwise engage in any marshalling of its assets and liabilities, the holders of the senior debt would \\nbe entitled to have the senior debt paid in full prior to the holders of the Bank Subordinated Note s receiving any \\npayment of principal of, or interest on, the Bank Subordinated Note s. In addition, if a default in the payment of \\nprincipal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, any senior debt occur s and is continuing past any applicable grace \\nperiod or if any event of default occurs and is continuing with respect to any senior debt or would occur with respect \\nto any senior debt if the Bank Subordinated Note  Issuer were to pay the principal of, or any interest on, the Bank \\nSubordinated Note s and that event of default would allow the holders of such senior debt to accelerate the maturity of \\nsuch senior debt, the Bank Subordinated Note  Issuer may not pay the principal of, or any interest on, the Bank \\nSubordinated Note s until such default or event of default is cured or waived or otherwise ceases to exist. The types of \\nsenior debt to which the Bank Subordinated Note s may be subordinated are described below under “ Security for the \\nNotes —Description of Bank  Subordinated Note s—Subordination. ” \\nThe underlying documents which govern the Bank Subordinated Note s included in the Trust Estate generally \\ndo not limit the amount of additional indebtedness or senior debt that the related Bank Subordinated Note  Issuer ma y \\nincur. In the future, a Bank Subordinated Note  Issuer may incur other indebtedness, which may be substantial in \\namount, including senior debt and debt ranking pari passu with the Bank Subordinated Note s.  As a consequence of \\nthe subordination of the Bank Subordinated Note s to senior debt, the Issuer, as an investor in the Bank Subordinated \\nNote s, may lose all or some of its investment should such bank liquidate or become insolvent. In such an event, the \\nassets of the Bank Subordinated Note  Issuer would be available to pay the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest \\non Bank Subordinated Note s only after all of its senior debt has been paid in full. In the event of a Bank Subordinated \\nNote  Issuer ’s liquidation, reorganization or other insolvency proceedings under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any other \\ninsolvency law (including the Federal Deposit Insurance Act), any general, unsecured obligations of such Bank \\nSubordinated Note  Issuer that do not constitute senior debt will sha re pro rata with the related Bank Subordinated \\nNote s in the assets remaining for payment of such obligations after payment in full of all senior debt.  \\n \\n40 Regulatory guidelines may restrict the ability of a Bank Subordinated Note  Issuer that is a holding compa ny from \\npaying the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest on, the Bank Subordinated Notes issued by it, regardless \\nof whether such holding company is subject to an insolvency proceeding.  \\nThe ability of a Bank Subordinated Note  Issuer that  is a bank holding company to pay the principal of, and \\ninterest on Bank Subordinated Note s issued by it is subject to the guidelines of the Federal Reserve regarding capital \\nadequacy. If such bank holding company intends to treat the Bank Subordinated Note s issued b y it as “ Tier 2 Capital”  \\nunder the Federal Reserve’ s regulatory capital rules and guidelines, the Federal Reserve guidelines generally require \\nreview of the effects of the cash payment of Tier 2 Capital instruments on the holding company’ s overall financia l \\ncondition. The guidelines also require review of net income for the current and past four quarters, and the amounts \\npaid on Tier 2 Capital instruments for those periods, as well as projected rate of earnings retention.  Moreover, under \\nthe Dodd- Frank Act , a bank holding company, savings and loan holding company or any other depository holding \\ncompany is required to act as a source of financial strength to its banking subsidiaries and commit resources to their \\nsupport, including the guarantee of capital pl ans of an undercapitalized bank subsidiary. Such support may be required \\nat times when a holding company may not otherwise be inclined to provide it. As a result of the foregoing, a Bank \\nSubordinated Note  Issuer that is a bank holding company may be unable  to pay accrued interest on the Bank \\nSubordinated Note s issued by it on one or more of the scheduled interest payment dates or at any other time or to pay \\nthe principal of such notes at maturity.  \\nNo limit or restriction exists on the amount or type of further securities or indebtedness that a Bank Subordinated Note  Issuer may issue, incur or guarantee . \\nNo limit or restriction typically exists on the amount of securities or other liabilities that a Bank Subordinated \\nNote  Issuer  may issue, incur or guarantee and that rank senior in right of payment to, or pari passu with, the Bank \\nSubordinated Note s issued by it. The issuance or guarantee of any such securities or the incurrence of any such other \\nliabilities may reduce the amount, if any, recoverable by holder s of the Bank Subordinated Note s in any insolvency \\nproceeding of the related Bank Subordinated Note  Issuer and may limit such Bank Subordinated Note  Issuer ’s ability \\nto meet its obligations under the Bank Subordinated Note s. In addition, typically there are no restrictions on the Bank \\nSubordinated Note  Issuer ’s ability to issue securities that may have preferential rights to the Bank Subordinated Note s \\nor securities with provisions similar to or different from the provisions  under which a Bank Subordinated Note  was \\nissued . Moreover, there are typically no covenants prohibiting a Bank Subordinated Note  Issuer from, or limiting its \\nright to, incur additional indebtedness or obligations, to grant liens on its assets to secure it s indebtedness or other \\nobligations, to issue or repurchase stock or other securities, including any of the Bank Subordinated Note s, or to pay \\ndividends or make other distributions to shareholders. The incurrence of additional debt or liabilities could adversely affect the ability to pay obligations on the Bank Subordinated Notes . In addition, the Bank Subordinated Note  \\nIndenture and/or Bank Subordinated Note  Purchase Agreement do not contain, among other things, provisions that \\nwould afford holders of the Bank Subordinated Note s protection in the event of a recapitalization transaction, a change \\nof control of the holding company or a highly leveraged transaction involving the holding company which could adversely affect the holders of the Notes.  \\nThe investm ent portfolio is concentrated by geography and asset size . \\nApproximately 15.33% of the aggregate Principal Balance of the Initial Portfolio Assets  were issued by \\nPortfolio Asse t Issuers that are located in Texas , approximately 12.26% of the aggregate Princ ipal Balance of the \\nInitial Portfolio Assets were issued by Portfolio Asset Issuers that are located in California  and approximately 9.02% \\nof the aggregate Principal Balance of the Initial Portfolio Assets were issued by Portfolio Asset Issuers that are located \\nin New York . As a res ult, credit deterioration in Texas, California  and New York  could have a significantly greater \\nnegative impact on the Trust Estate, which could have a material adverse effect on the Notes.  \\nPortfolio Assets of non- U.S. Portfolio Asset Issuers may expose the Issuer to different economic risks, legal \\nand regulatory uncertainties and potential impairment of enforcement actions against such obligors . \\nPortfolio Assets of  obligors located outside the United States and its terr itories may involve greater risks than \\nPortfolio Assets of  obligors located in the Unit ed States and its territories. These risks include: (a)  less publicly \\navailable information about the related obligor; (b)  varying levels of governmental regulation and supervision; and \\n(c) the difficulty of enforcing legal rights in a foreign jurisdiction and related uncertainties as to the status, \\n \\n41 interpretation and application of laws.  Moreover, foreign entities  are generally not subject to uniform accounting, \\nauditin g and financial reporting standards, practices and requirements comparable to those applicable to U.S. \\ncompanies.  \\nHistorically, there has been less governmental supervision and regulation of exchanges, brokers and issuers \\nin foreign countries than there is  in the United States.  For example, there may be no comparable provisions under \\ncertain foreign laws with respect to insider trading and similar investor protection securities laws that apply with \\nrespect to securities transactions consummated in the Unit ed States.   \\nIn certain foreign countries there is the possibility of expropriation, nationalization, or confiscatory taxation; \\nlimitations on the convertibility of currency or the removal of securities, property, or other assets of the Issuer; \\npolitical, economic, or social instability; or adverse diplomatic developments, each of which could have an adverse \\neffect on the Issuer ’s investments in the foreign countries (which may make  it more difficult to pay U.S. d ollar \\ndenominated obligations).  The economi es of individual non -U.S. countries may also differ favorably or unfavorably \\nfrom the U.S. economy in such respects as the effect of a  global recession, growth or contraction of the gross domestic \\nproduct, rate of inflation, volatility of currency exchange  rates, depreciation, capital reinvestment, resource \\nself-sufficiency, and balance of payments position.  Accordingly, Portfolio Assets of non- U.S. obligors could face \\nrisks which would not pertain to Portfolio Assets of U.S. obligors, which could expose t he Issuer to losses on such \\nPortfolio Assets.   \\nBalloon and bullet payments present refinancing risk . \\nThe Issuer ’s investment portfolio will consist of Portfolio Assets that require bullet and balloon payments. \\nThese payment structures involve a greater degree of risk than other types of transactions because they are structured \\nto allow for no principal payments over the term of the bond, requiring the obligor to make a large final payment upon \\nthe maturity of the Portfolio Asset. The ability of s uch obligor to make this final payment upon the maturity of the \\nPortfolio Asset typically depends upon its ability either to refinance the Portfolio Asset prior to maturity or to generate \\nsufficient cash flow to repay the Portfolio Asset at maturity. The a bility of any obligor to accomplish any of these \\ngoals will be affected by many factors, including the availability of financing at acceptable rates to such obligor, the financial condition of such obligor, the marketability of the collateral (if any) securing such Portfolio Asset, the \\noperating history of the related business, tax laws and the prevailing general economic conditions. Consequently, such \\nobligor may not have the ability to repay the Portfolio Asset at maturity, and the Issuer could lose all or most of the \\nprincipal of the Portfolio Asset. Given their relative size and limited resources and access to capital, some obligors \\nmay have difficulty in repaying or refinancing their bullet Portfolio Asset on a timely basis or at all.  \\nImpact of Defaults , Deferrals and Payment Restrictions Relating to the Portfolio Assets . \\nA default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any Portfolio Asset or a deferral \\nof distributions on any Portfolio Asset will decrease the amount of cash available to the Issuer to make payments on the Notes and therefore may result in a default in or deferral of the amount due on the Notes. In such event, the \\nNoteholders may incur a loss on their investment in the Notes.  \\nLimited Disclosure about Portfolio As sets and use of Distributed Ledger Technology . \\nHolders of Notes will receive limited information with regards to the Portfolio Assets and none of the Issuer, \\nthe Trustee, the Collateral Manager, the Initial Purchaser s, the Placement Agent  or their respecti ve Affiliates will be \\nrequired to provide any information it receives pursuant to the Portfolio Assets and related documents other than what \\nis required in the Indenture and the Collateral Management Agreement. In particular, the Collateral Manager will no t \\nhave any obligation to keep any of these parties informed as to matters arising in relation to any Portfolio Asset, except \\nas may be required in connection with the regular reports provided in accordance with the Indenture.  \\nIn addition, while the Issuer is not obligated to do so, the Issuer intends to make certain information regarding \\nthe Portfolio Assets and the Notes available to Holders of Notes via distributed ledger technology provided through Brightvine. Use of Brightvine’s distributed ledger technology may be cancelled by the Issuer at any time without \\nnotice to the Holders.  \\n \\n42 The application of distributed ledger technology is novel and untested and may contain inherent flaws or \\nlimitations. The operation of the distributed ledger technology may be subject to potential technical, legal and \\nregulatory constraints. In addition, there is no warranty that the distributed ledger technology will be uninterrupted or \\nerror- free and the distributed ledger could be compromised, and breakdowns  could cause the partial or complete \\ninability to use the platform provided by Brightvine. The Holders of Notes should not rely on the distributed ledger for any purposes as it relates to the Portfolio Assets or the Notes and the Issuer is not responsible for any misleading, \\nomitted or inaccurate information provided via the distributed ledger regarding the Portfolio Assets or the Notes. None of the Issuer nor the Holders of Notes will have recourse from relying on data provided via distributed ledger techn ology through Brightvine.  \\nLimited Liquidity of Portfolio Assets; Restrictions in the Indenture to sell Portfolio Assets  and purchase additional \\nPortfolio Assets .  \\nThe Indenture allows the Collateral Manager to sell Portfolio Assets ( including  a Defaulted S ecurity, a Credit \\nRisk Security or an APAI Security) so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.   See Section 12.1 \\nof the Indenture.  The Collateral Manager on behalf of the Issuer may use some or all of APAI Security Sales Proceeds \\nand/or Prepayment Security Proceeds to purchase one or more additional Portfolio Assets subject to satisfaction of each of the conditions set out in the Reinvestment Criteria, provided that the Issuer purchases or commits to purchase \\nsuch Portfolio Asset by no later than the applicable Reinvestment Cut- Off Date. Sale Proceeds from other Portfolio \\nAssets may not be reinvested . Accordingly, during certain periods or in certain circumstances, the Collateral Manager \\nmay be unable as a result of such restri ctions to sell Portfolio Assets or purchase additional Portfolio Assets or to take \\nother actions which it might consider to be in the best interests of the Issuer and the holders of the Notes and/or \\nexperience delays in selling , purchasing or otherwise taking action s.  \\nThe ability of the Issuer to acquire Portfolio Assets that satisfy the Rei nvestment Criteria at the projected \\nprices, ratings, rates of interest and any other applicable characteristics will be subject to market conditions and \\navailability of such Portfolio Assets .  Any inability of the Issuer to acquire Portfolio Assets that sa tisfy the \\nReinvestment Criteria may adversely affect the timing and amount of payments received by the holders of Notes and \\nthe yield to maturity of the Notes and the distributions on the Preferred Shares . \\nMost of the Portfolio Assets securing the Notes wi ll be privately issued securities, and all of the Portfolio \\nAssets were either acquired by the Issuer upon original issuance or in the secondary market. Significant restrictions \\napply to the transfer of Portfolio Assets.  \\nLittle or no publicly available inf ormation may be available with respect to Portfolio Asset Issuers that are \\nnot reporting companies under the Exchange Act. As a result, the Portfolio Assets will be extremely illiquid investments.  \\nWith respect to Defaulted Securities, the Collateral Manag er may  take, or may direct the Trustee to take , \\nsuch action as the Collateral Manager may deem advisable, including engaging in a restructuring, bringing enforcement proceedings and/or taking other measures, subject to the remedial provisions in the underl ying \\ndocumentation. Such actions will subject the Issuer and the Noteholders to greater uncertainties with respect to the timing and amount of any ultimate recovery than a sale of the Defaulted Securities. In the event that any such sale is made, the Issuer generally expects that the proceeds from such sale of such Portfolio Asset will be less than the \\noutstanding Principal Balance thereof (plus any unpaid accrued interest). In addition, because the Portfolio Assets are \\nextremely illiquid investments, there  can be no assurance that any sale will be consummated in connection with an \\nattempted Optional Redemption by Liquidation.  \\nConcentration risk.  \\nThe concentration of the Initial Portfolio Assets with respect to any particular obligor  or state of the United \\nStates is described under “ Security for the Notes —Portfolio  Statistics of the Initial Portfolio Assets ”, and such \\nconcentration can increase over time as Portfolio Assets  mature or are sold (or as a result of reinvestment to the extent \\npermitted by the Indenture). The concentration of the portfolio in any one o bligor would subject the Note s to a greater \\ndegree of risk with respect to defaults by such o bligor, and the concentration of the port folio in the banking industry \\nsubject s the Note s to a greater degree of risk with respect to economic downturns relating to the banking industry.  \\n \\n43 There are no geographic restrictions on reinvestments in additional Portfolio Assets. See “ Security for the N otes—\\nActivities of Collateral Manager with respect to Portfolio  Assets and Eligible Investments ”. \\nNegative Carry . \\nThe payment dates with respect to Portfolio Assets may be several weeks or months prior to the Payment \\nDates with respect to the Notes. In addition, the number of days between the payment dates on the Portfolio Assets \\nand the Payment Dates with respect to the Notes may be less than the number of days in the cure period for late \\npayments of interest with respect to the Portfolio Assets. As suc h, it is possible that interest on Portfolio Assets may \\nbe paid after the Payment Date with respect to the Notes yet before its late payment has matured into an event of \\ndefault with respect to such Portfolio Assets.  \\nPayments received on Portfolio Assets a fter the end of the applicable Due Period will be invested in Eligible \\nInvestments that mature on or prior to the next succeeding related Payment Date pending distribution on such Payment \\nDate. The rate of interest earned on Eligible Investments is expected to be significantly less than the rate of interest payable on the Portfolio Assets or the Notes.  \\nCredit ratings are not a guarantee of quality . \\nCredit ratings of assets represent the rating agencies ’ opinions regarding their credit quality and are not a \\nguarantee of quality or performance.  Credit ratings address the timely payment of interest on non -deferrable Classes \\nand the ultimate payment of principal by the Stated Maturity Date. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, \\nsell or hold assets and  may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. If a rating \\nassigned to any Portfolio Asset is lowered for any reason, no party is obligated to provide any additional support or credit enhancement with respect to such Portfolio Asset. Rating agencies attempt to evaluate the relative future \\ncreditworthiness of an obligation and do not address other risks, including but not limited to, the likelihood of principal \\nprepayments (both voluntary and involuntary), liquidit y risk, market value or price volatility; therefore, ratings do not \\nfully reflect the true risks of an investment. Also, rating agencies may fail to make timely changes in credit ratings in response to subsequent events, so that an obligor ’s current financial condition may be better or worse than a rating \\nindicates. Further, rating agencies may change credit rating methodology in response to recent legislative and \\nregulatory initiatives and legal actions directed against rating agencies. Consequently, credit rat ings of any Portfolio \\nAsset  (as is also the case in respect of the Notes) should be used only as a preliminary indicator of perceived \\ninvestment quality and should not be considered a reliable indicator of actual investment quality. Rating reductions or withdrawals may occur for any number of reasons and may affect numerous assets at a single time or within a short \\nperiod of time, with material adverse effects upon the Notes. It is possible that many credit ratings of assets included in or similar to the P ortfolio Assets will be subject to significant or severe adjustments downward. See “—Risks  \\nRelating to the Notes —Future Actions of the Rating Agency and other NRSROs can adversely affect the market value \\nor liquidity of the Notes .” \\nOptional Redemptions and  Prepayments of the Portfolio Assets . \\nCollections from optional redemptions or prepayments of Portfolio Assets will be deposited in the Collection \\nAccount and will be applied in accordance with the Priority of Payments to the extent not reinvested in addit ional \\nPortfolio Assets in accordance with the Indenture . Optional redemption or prepayment on the Portfolio Assets will be \\ninfluenced by, among other things, the prevailing levels of interest rates and spreads (which is expected to affect the incentive of the Portfolio Asset Issuers to voluntarily prepay the Portfolio Assets), the business prospects, financial \\ncondition and results of operation of the Portfolio Asset Issuers and the availability of alternative financing in the form \\nof equity, debt or hybrid instruments (which is expected to affect the ability of the Portfolio Asset Issuers to refinance \\nthe Portfolio Assets), changes in regulatory or accounting treatment of the Portfolio Assets , the occurrence of changes \\nor prospective changes involving tax l aw, the Investment Company Act or applicable regulator capital adequacy \\nguidelines (any of which could permit the redemption of the Portfolio Assets), and whether permission of the \\napplicable regulator is required, directly or indirectly, for prepayment of  any Portfolio Assets under regulatory capital \\nadequacy guidelines and, if so, whether the a pplicable regulator grants such permission. Prepayments and optional \\nredemptions may adversely affect the timing and amount of payments received by holders of Notes and the yield to \\nmaturity of the Notes.  \\n \\n44 While on the Closing Date, all of the Portfolio Assets will pay interest at a fixed rate, the interest rate on \\napproximately 97.48% of the aggregate Principal Balance of the Portfolio Assets will convert to a floating rate about \\n5 years after the date of issuance.  The weighted average spread over the applicable benchmark rate with respect to \\nthe fixed/floating rate Bank Subordinated Note s during the period they pay interest at a floating rate is expected to be \\napproximately 3.76% although a significant portion of such Portfolio Assets will have spreads over the applicable \\nbenchmark rate that are less than 3 .25%. To the extent that optional redemptions or prepayments of Portfolio Assets \\nand/or sales of  Portfolio Assets are concentrated among Portfolio Assets with relatively higher spreads (and, in the \\ncase of sales of APAI Securities  or Prospective Prepayment Security or in the case of optional redemptions or \\nprepayments, the proceeds thereof are not reinvested in  additional Portfolio Assets with comparable or higher spreads), \\nthe lower weighted average spread of the remaining Portfolio Assets will result in reduced Interest Collections. Any \\nsuch concentration could adversely affect the ability of the Issuer to make interest payments on the Notes.  \\nRelating to the Collateral Manager  \\nLimited Operating and Management History of the Collateral Manager . \\nThe Collateral Manager is a Delaware limited liability company and has a limited prior operating history and \\ntrack reco rd. The Issuer will be the first CBO managed by the Collateral Manager .  However, the Collateral Manager \\nhas acted as the services provider for two CBOs managed by its affiliate.  Under the services agreement for those \\nCBOs, the Collateral Manager provided services of an administrative and/or advisory nature to such other CBOs, \\nincluding accounting, trading, risk management, compliance support, portfolio analysis, operations, legal, research \\nand other administrative services.  In addition, the Collateral Ma nager acts as the portfolio manager for the Issuer, in  \\nits capacity as the issuer under the Warehouse Agreement, and manages and administers certain assets similar to the \\nPortfolio Assets for accounts and funds managed by it .  Accordingly, the Collateral Manager has limited performance \\nhistory for prospective investors to evaluate in making a decision whether or not to invest in the Notes.  \\nThe Collateral Manager is a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The \\nCollateral Manager is an SEC registered, employee -owned, alternative asset management firm that manages \\napproximately $2 5.6 billion of assets as of March 31, 20 22 across a diverse group of alternative asset strategies. See \\n“Collateral Manager ” and “The Coll ateral Management Agreement .” \\nPast performance of the Collateral Manager not indicative . \\nThe past performance of t he Collateral Manager and Affiliates thereof in managing other portfolios , funds, \\naccounts or investment vehicles may not be indicative of the results that the Collateral Manager may be able to achieve \\nwith the Portfolio Assets . The past performance of the Collateral Manager and Affiliates thereof over a particular \\nperiod may not be indicative of the results that may occur in future periods. Furthermore, the nature of, and risks associated with, the Issuer ’s investments, as selected by the Collateral Manager, may differ from those investments \\nand strategies undertaken historically by the Collateral Manager  and Affiliates thereof.  There can be no assurance that \\nthe Issuer ’s investments will perform as well as past investments of the Collateral Manager or of Affiliates thereof, \\nthat the Issuer will be able to avoid losses or that the Issuer will be able to make investments similar to such past \\ninvestments. In addition, such past investments may have been made utilizing a leveraged capital structure and an \\nasset mix and fee arrangements that are different from the anticipated capital structure, asset mix and fee arrangements \\nof the Is suer. Moreover, because the investment criteria and regulatory requirements that govern investments in the \\nPortfolio Assets do not govern certain of the Collateral Manager ’s investments and investment strategies generally, \\nsuch investments conducted in acc ordance with such criteria, and the results they yield, are not directly comparable \\nwith, and may differ substantially from, other investments undertaken by the Collateral Manager and Affiliates thereof.  \\nDependence on Key Personnel . \\nThe performance of the Portfolio Assets depends in part on the skills of the Collateral Manager in selecting \\nand acquiring the Portfolio Assets as well as monitoring the Portfolio Assets. In addition, the Collateral Manager will \\ndirect the Trustee on behalf of the Issuer as to t he disposition of any Portfolio Assets  (including with respect to the \\npricing thereof) and will make certain decisions with respect to the exercise of rights by the Issuer as holder of the \\nPortfolio Assets. As a result, the Issuer will be dependent on the financial and managerial experience of the Collateral \\nManager and certain of the Collateral Manager personnel to whom the task of managing the Collateral has been \\n \\n45 assigned. In the event that one or more of the Collateral Manager personnel were no longer available to provide \\nservices to the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Manager would have to reassign responsibilities, contract for \\nadditional personnel and/or hire one or more employees, each of which could have a material adverse effect on the \\nperformanc e of the Issuer. See “ Collateral Manager ” and “The Collateral Management Agreement .” \\nWhile investment professionals associated with the Collateral Manager will devote such time as they \\ndetermine in their discretion is reasonably necessary to fulfill the Collateral Manager’s obligations to the Issuer \\neffectively, they are actively involved in other investment activities not concerning the Issuer, and none of them will devote all of their professional time to the affairs of the Issuer. Any such investment professionals may cease to be \\nassociated with the Collateral Manager after the date hereof. In addition, individuals not currently associated with the \\nCollateral Manager may become associated with the Collateral Manager in the future, and the performance of  the \\nPortfolio Assets may also depend on the financial and managerial experience of such individuals.  \\nThe Collateral Manager will be dependent on third party consultants for the provision of certain services \\nunder the Transaction Documents  \\nAlthough the Iss uer’s activities will be directed by the Collateral Manager, the Collateral Manager will \\ndepend on certain third party consultants to provide services to the Collateral Manager under the Transaction Documents. Consequently, while the success of the Issuer will depend, in large part, on the skill and expertise of the \\nCollateral Manager’s investment professionals to whom the task of managing the Portfolio Assets has been assigned, \\nthe Collateral Manager’s ability to carry out its obligations to the Issuer may  depend in part on the performance of \\nservices by certain third party consultants. The Collateral Manager may not be able to perform its duties and \\nobligations under the Collateral Management Agreement if services by such third party consultants are terminated or incomplete. None of the Issuer, the Trustee or any holder of Notes will have recourse to such third party consultants.  \\nPotential Conflicts of Interest  \\nVarious potential and actual conflicts of interest may arise from the overall business and inves tment activities \\nof the Collateral Manager , the Initial Purchaser s, the Placement Agent, their respective Affiliates (including their \\nrespective partners, directors, officers and employees) and their respective clients, which include issuers of Portfolio \\nAssets and their Affiliates. The following briefly summarizes some of these conflicts, but is not intended to be an \\nexhaustive discussion of all potential conflicts.  \\nConflicts of Interest Involving the Collateral Manager . \\nVarious potential and actual confli cts of interest may arise from the overall advisory, investment and other \\nactivities of the Collateral Manager and its Affiliates for their own accounts or for their respective client accounts. \\nThe Collateral Manager does not have an obligation, except in the limited circumstances set forth in the Collateral \\nManagement Agreement, to disclose these conflicts on an ongoing basis. The Collateral Manager and/or its Affiliates \\nmay have ongoing relationships with, render services to, engage in transactions with a nd, in the case of such Affiliates, \\ninvest in other issuers of collateralized debt obligations that invest in assets of a similar nature to those securing the \\nNotes, and with companies whose securities are pledged to secure the Notes. Affiliates of the Col lateral Manager, and \\naccounts and funds managed by the Collateral Manager or its Affiliates, may also own equity or debt securities issued \\nby issuers of and other obligors on Portfolio Assets. As a result, officers or Affiliates of the Collateral Manager m ay \\npossess information relating to issuers of Portfolio Assets that is not known to the individuals at the Collateral Manager that are responsible for monitoring the Portfolio Assets and performing the other obligations under the Collateral \\nManagement Agreement. The Collateral Manager will not be required to share such information with the Issuer or \\nany Holder of any Note. The Collateral Manager will not have any liability to the Issuer or any Holder of any Note \\nfor failure to disclose such information or f or taking, or failing to take, any action based upon such information. The \\nCollateral Manager may in the future serve as collateral manager or adviser or sub -adviser for other securitization \\nvehicles (or similar entities) on terms materially different from  those applicable between the Collateral Manager and \\nthe Issuer and, accordingly, the Collateral Manager may have incentives to favor any one or more other securitization vehicles (or similar entities) over the Issuer. In addition, Affiliates and clients o f the Collateral Manager may invest \\nin securities that are senior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the securities that are pledged to secure \\nthe Notes. The Collateral Manager and/or its Affiliates may at certain times be simultaneously s eeking to purchase or \\n \\n46 dispose of investments for its respective account, the Issuer, any similar entity for which it serves as manager or \\nadviser and for its other clients or Affiliates.  \\nNone of the Collateral Manager or any of its Affiliates is under any obligation to offer investment \\nopportunities of which they become aware to the Issuer or to account to the Issuer for (or share with the Issuer or inform the Issuer of) any such transaction or any benefit received by them from any such transaction or to in form the \\nIssuer of any investments before offering any investments to other funds or accounts that the Collateral Manager and/or any of its Affiliates manage or advise. Furthermore, the Collateral Manager and/or any its Affiliates may make an investment on behalf of any account that they manage or advise without offering the investment opportunity or \\nmaking any investment on behalf of the Issuer. The Collateral Manager and/or any of its Affiliates have no affirmative \\nobligation to offer any investments to t he Issuer or to inform the Issuer of any investments before offering any \\ninvestments to other funds or accounts that the Collateral Manager and/or any of its Affiliates manage or advise. Furthermore, the Collateral Manager and/or any of its Affiliates may make an investment on their own behalf without \\noffering the investment opportunity to the Issuer or the Collateral Manager making any investment on behalf of the Issuer. Affirmative obligations may exist or may arise in the future, whereby the Collateral M anager and/or any of its \\nAffiliates are obligated to offer certain investments to funds or accounts that they manage or advise before or without \\nthe Collateral Manager offering those investments to the Issuer. The Collateral Manager and its Affiliates have no \\naffirmative obligation to offer any investments to the Issuer or to inform the Issuer of any investments before engaging in any investments for themselves. The Collateral Manager may make investments on behalf of the Issuer in securities, \\nor other asse ts, that it has declined to invest in for its own account, the account of any of its Affiliates or the account \\nof its other clients. The Collateral Manager will endeavor to resolve conflicts with respect to investment opportunities \\nin a manner that it deem s equitable under the facts and circumstances.  \\nAlthough the Collateral Manager personnel will devote as much time to the Issuer as the Collateral Manager \\ndeems appropriate, the Collateral Manager personnel may have conflicts in allocating their time and services among \\nthe Issuer and the Collateral Manager’s other accounts and clients. In addition, as employees of the Collateral \\nManager, the Collateral Manager personnel will have substantial responsibilities outside of their responsibilities to \\nperform servi ces for the Collateral Manager under the Collateral Management Agreement. In addition, the Collateral \\nManager is expected to use certain third party consultants to perform certain responsibilities under the Transaction \\nDocuments. These third party consulta nts will devote as much time to performing responsibilities as they deem \\nappropriate, however, such consultants may have conflicts in allocating their time and services among their other \\naccounts and clients.  \\nThe Collateral Manager and Affiliates of the C ollateral Manager may (for their own accounts or for the \\naccounts of others) purchase or sell any Notes in the initial offering thereof or at any time thereafter without notice to any party and at its sole discretion.  \\nCertain funds and accounts managed by the Collateral Manager are expected to purchase all of the Preferred \\nShares on the Closing Date. Such funds and accounts will have no obligation to retain such Preferred Shares and may \\ndispose of them at any time.  \\nAt all times that Angel Oak Capital Advisors or any of its Affiliates is acting as Collateral Manager, Securities \\nheld by, or with respect to which discretionary voting rights are held by, Angel Oak Capital Advisors or any of its Affiliates will have no voting rights with respect to any vote in connection with the removal of the Collateral Manager \\nand will be deemed not to be outstanding in connection with any such vote. However, any Securities held by, or with respect to which discretionary voting rights are held by, Angel Oak Capital Advisors a nd any of its Affiliates or their \\nrespective employees will have voting rights with respect to all other matters as to which the holders of the Securities \\nare entitled to vote, including, without limitation, any vote in connection with an Optional Redempti on by Liquidation, \\nOptional Redemption by Refinancing or the appointment of a replacement collateral manager in accordance with the \\nCollateral Management Agreement. See “The Collateral Management Agreement .” \\nThe Collateral Manager may arrange principal transactions where the Collateral Manager or an Affiliate of \\nthe Collateral Manager, acting for its own account, buys Portfolio Assets or Eligible Investments from, or sells Portfolio Assets or Eligible Investments to, the Issuer ( “Principal Transactions ”). Such Principal Transactions give \\nrise to a conflict of interests with respect to the Collateral Manager. The Collateral Manager will provide written notice \\nof any Principal Transaction to the Issuer or to any agent appointed by the Issuer for this purpose and obtain the written \\n \\n47 consent of the Issuer or such agent prior to completion of such Principal Transaction. Such consent may be provided \\non behalf of the Issuer by its board of directors .   \\nThe Collateral Manager may also effect client cross transactions where the Collateral Manager causes a \\ntransaction to be effected between the Issuer and another account advised by it or any of its Affiliates ( “Client Cross \\nTransactions ”). In add ition, with prior authorization on behalf of the Issuer by its board of directors, which \\nauthorization can be revoked by the board of directors at any time, the Collateral Manager may enter into agency cross transactions where it or any of its Affiliates a cts as broker for the Issuer and for the other party to the transaction \\n(“Agency Cross Transactions ”), to the extent permitted by applicable law, in which case it or any such Affiliate may \\nreceive commissions from, and have a potentially conflicting division of loyalties and responsibilities regarding, both \\nparties to the transaction. Although the Affiliates of the Collateral Manager anticipate that the commissions, mark -ups \\nand mark -downs charged by the Affiliates will gen erally be competitive, the Collateral Manager or any of its Affiliates \\nmay have interests in such transactions that are adverse to those of the Issuer, such as an interest in obtaining favorable \\ncommission rates, mark -ups and mark- downs. In addition, other  potential and actual conflicts of interest may arise in \\nconnection with Client Cross Transactions or Agency Cross Transactions.  \\nBy its investment in the Notes, each investor will be deemed to have consented to the entry by the Issuer into \\nPrincipal Transa ctions, Client Cross Transactions and Agency Cross Transactions pursuant to the procedures \\ndescribed above.  \\nThere is no limitation or restriction on Angel Oak Capital Advisors  or any of its Affiliates with regard to \\nacting as collateral manager (or in a si milar role) to other parties or persons. This and other future activities of the \\nCollateral Manager and its Affiliates may give rise to additional conflicts of interest.  \\nAll of  the Portfolio Assets to be acquired by the Issuer as of the Closing Date , which  constitute approximately \\n100% of the aggregate Principal Balance of the Initial Portfolio Assets,  will be acquired pursuant to the Warehouse \\nAgreement .  \\nIn addition, a fund managed by the  Collateral Manager , as the equity investor in the warehousing facil ity \\nprovided by Warehouse  Agreement , will bear the risk of loss in value of the assets financed by such warehouse facility \\n(and which are expected to be acquired by the Issuer on the Closing Date ). This may provide an incentive for the \\nCollateral Manager t o close the transaction in non- optimal conditions.  \\nConflicts of Interest Relating to Jefferies Entities . \\nVarious potential and actual conflicts of interest may arise as a result of the investment banking, asset \\nmanagement, financing and financial advisory services and products provided by Jefferies and/or its affiliates (each, a “Jefferies Entity ” and together, “ Jefferies Entities ”) to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Collateral Administrator, the \\nCollateral Manager, the issuers of the Portfolio Assets and others, as well as in connection with the investment, trading and brokerage activities of the Jefferies Entities.  The following briefly summarizes some of these conflicts, but is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all such conflicts.  \\nJefferies will act as an Initial Purchaser of the Co -Issued Note s. Certain of the Portfolio Assets acquired by \\nthe Issuer may be obligations of issuers or obligors for which a Jefferies Entity has acted as a str ucturing or syndication \\nagent, a manager, an underwriter, an agent, a placement agent, an initial purchaser or a principal, or of which any of \\nthe Jefferies Entities is an equity owner or creditor or with which any of the Jefferies Entities has other business \\nrelationships.  \\nThe Collateral Manager may purchase or sell Portfolio Assets from time to time through the Jefferies Entities \\nat market prices. Any purchases of Portfolio Assets described above involving a Jefferies Entity may only be effected by the I ssuer if the Collateral Manager determines that such purchases are consistent with the investment guidelines \\nand objectives of the Issuer and the restrictions prescribed by the Indenture. In any event, all of such purchases and \\nsales of assets will be requ ired to be on an arm ’s length basis.  An Affiliate of Jefferies is also providing warehouse \\nfinancing to permit acquisitions of Portfolio Assets prior to the Closing Date. For further details, see “ Risk Factors —\\nPotential Conflicts of Interest— Pre-Closing C ollateral Accumulation ”. \\n \\n48 The Jefferies Entities may be actively engaged in transactions in some of the same Portfolio Assets in which \\nthe Issuer may invest. Such transactions may be different from those made on behalf of the Issuer. Subject to applicable \\nlaw, a Jefferies Entity may purchase or sell the securities of, or otherwise invest in or finance or provide investment \\nbanking, advisory and other services to companies in which the Issuer has an interest or in which the Collateral \\nManager, its affiliates or funds or accounts managed by the Collateral Manager or its affiliates have an interest or to \\nother accounts managed by the Collateral Manager and its affiliates.  The Jefferies Entities may also have a proprietary \\ninterest in, and may manage or advise o ther accounts or investment funds that have investment objectives similar or \\ndissimilar to those of the Issuer and/or which engage in transactions in, the same types of assets as the Issuer ’s. As a \\nresult, a Jefferies Entity may possess information relatin g to o bligors, or Affiliates of such o bligors, on or issuers of \\nPortfolio Assets that will not be known to the Collateral Manager. None of Jefferies or any of its affiliates is under any obligation to share any investment opportunity, idea or strategy with the Collateral Manager or the Issuer. As a \\nresult, the Jefferies Entities may analyze and make decisions regarding investments that would be relevant to the Issuer and will be under no duty or obligation to share such information or analysis with the Issuer. In addition, a Jefferies Entity or any of its respective clients, may invest in debt obligations and securities that are senior to, or have interests \\ndifferent from or adverse to, the Portfolio Assets. None of the Jefferies Entities assume any responsi bility for, or has \\nany obligations in respect of, the Issuer, or in ensuring that any of its activities described above take into account the \\ninterests of the Issuer or any holders.  \\nThe Jefferies Entities may own positions in, and may have placed or underwritten certain of, the Portfolio \\nAssets (or other obligations of the o bligors or such o bligors ’ Affiliates) when they were originally issued, and may \\nhave provided, or be providing, investment banking services and other services to o bligors of certain Portfolio Assets. \\nIt is expected that from time to time the Collateral Manager will, subject to the limitations in the Indenture, sell \\nPortfolio Assets through or to, Jefferies Entities.  Any of the Jefferies Entities may act as placement agent and/or initial \\npurchaser in other transactions involving the issuance of collateralized debt obligations or other investment funds with assets similar to those of the Issuer, the existence of which may have an adverse effect from time to time on the \\navailability of eligible Portfolio Assets for purchase by the Issuer.  \\nThe Issuer also may invest in Portfolio Assets of o bligors affiliated with Jefferies or in which a Jefferies \\nEntity has an equity or participation interest. The purchase, holding and sale of such investments by the Issuer may enhance the profitability of a Jefferies Entity ’s own investments in such companies.  \\nIn addition, on the Closing  Date, a Jefferies Entity may, but is not under any obligation, to purchase for its \\nown account all or some of the Note s of any Class, and no assurance is given that a Jefferies Entity will do so. In \\naddition, from time to time after the Closing  Date, a Jefferies Entity may buy or sell Notes for its own acc ount or for \\nre-packaging purposes, or enter into transactions related or linked to all or some of the Notes. In the future, a Jefferies \\nEntity may, but will not be required to, repurchase and resell any of the Notes in market -making transactions.  \\nJefferie s will be paid a fee by the Issuer on the Closing  Date for its services to the Issuer as an Initial \\nPurchaser, which fee will be included among the transactional and closing expenses used to determine the amount of the net proceeds resulting from the issua nce and sale of the Co-Issued Note s. \\nConflicts of Interest Involving Piper Sandler & Co.  and its Affiliates.  \\nPiper Sandler &  Co. will serve as an Initial Purchaser of the Co-Issued Note s and as Placement Agent of the \\nIssuer -Only Notes and will be paid fees and commissions for such service by the Issuer from the proceeds of the \\nissuance of the  Note s.  Piper Sandler & Co., its predecessors and their respective Affiliates ( collectively, “Piper  \\nSandler & Co. ”) may have ha d in the past and may in the future have business relationships and dealings with one or \\nmore issuers of the Portfolio Assets  and their Affiliates and may own equity or debt securities issued by such  issuers \\nor their Affiliates. Piper Sandler & Co.  may have provided and may in the future provide investment banking services \\n(including capital raising services and/or financial advisory services) to any issuer of the Portfolio Assets  or any of its \\nAffiliates  and may have received or may receive compensation for such services. Piper Sandler & Co. may buy \\nsecurities from and sell securities to any issuer of the Portfolio Assets  or any of its Affiliates for their own a ccount or \\nfor the accounts of their customer s. \\n \\n49 Piper Sandler & Co. may, but is not obligated to, advise the Issuer, the Collateral Manager, the issuers of the \\nPortfolio Assets  or any of their respective Affiliates with respect to restructuring or working out any of their debt \\nobligations, including,  without limitation, the Portfolio Assets . Piper Sandler & Co. may from time to time hold Note s \\nfor investment, trading or other purposes. Piper Sandler & Co. is not required to own or hold any Notes and may sell \\nany Notes held by it at any time without re striction. If Piper Sandler & Co. owns Note s, it will have no responsibility \\nto consider the interests of any other owners of Note s in actions it takes or refrains from taking in such capacity.  \\nPiper Sandler & Co. may, by virtue of the relationships described above or otherwise, at the date hereof or at \\nany time hereafter, be in possession of information regarding certain of the issuers of the Portfolio Assets  and their \\nrespective Affiliates that is or may be materi al in the context of the Note s and that is or may not be known to the \\ngeneral public. Piper Sandler & Co. has no obligation, and the offering of the Note s pursuant to this Offering Circular  \\nwill not create any obligation on its part, to disclose to any pur chaser of the Note s any such relationship or information, \\nwhether or not confidential.   \\nPiper Sandler & Co. takes no responsibility for, and has no obligations in respect of, the Issuer and will have \\nno obligation to monitor the performance of the Portfolio Assets  or the actions of the Collateral Manager or the Issuer \\nand will have no authority to advise the Collateral Manager or the Issuer or to direct their actions, which will be solely \\nthe responsibility of the Collateral Manager and the Issuer.  \\nThe Initial Purchaser s and the Placement Agent  will have no ongoing responsibility for the Portfolio Assets or \\nthe actions of the Collateral Manager  or the Issuer.   \\nThe Initial Purchaser s and the Placement Agent will have no obligation to monitor the performance of the \\nPortfolio Assets or the actions of the Collateral Manager  or the Issuer and will have no authority to advise the Collateral \\nManager  or the Issuer or to direct their actions, which will be solely the responsibility of the Collateral Manager  and/or \\nthe Issuer, as the case may be. In addition, the Initial Purchaser s and the Placement Agent have no obligation to \\nfacilitate dialogues among investors in the Notes or the Preferred Shares. If Jefferies  or Piper Sandler & Co.  owns any \\nNotes, it will have no re sponsibility to consider the interests of any holders of Notes in actions it takes in such capacity. \\nWhile Jefferies  or Piper Sandler & Co.  may own any Class of Notes at any time, neither has any obligation to make \\nany investment in any Notes and may sell at any time any Notes it does purchase.  \\nPre-Closing Collateral Accumulation.  \\nAn affiliate of Jefferies (the “ Warehouse Provider” ) and a fund managed by the Collateral Manager  (the \\n“First Loss Provider ”), entered into a warehous ing agreement  (the “Warehouse Agreement ”) with the Issuer and \\nthe Collateral Manager  under which the Warehouse Provider provided financing and, during the period prior to the \\npricing date of the transaction, the First Loss Provider provided first loss financing to the Issuer for the “ warehousing”  \\nof all or substantially all of  the Initial Portfolio Assets . \\nThese warehoused assets (the “Warehoused Assets ”) were selected by the Collateral Manager , with the \\nexpectation that either the Warehouse Provider or a warehouse counterparty (the “Warehouse Counterparty ”) that \\nis not affiliated with, or under the control of, the Collateral Manager  or the Warehouse Provider, would acquire such \\nassets in accordance with certain contractual arrangements between the Warehouse Provider and the Warehouse \\nCounterparty.   In addition, approximately 30% of the Warehoused Assets were acquired from another CBO managed \\nby an affiliate of the Collateral Manager in connection with an optional redemption of that CBO.  The acquisitions of \\nthe Warehoused Assets have been effected according to terms prevailing in the market at the respective times of the \\nrespective acquisitions thereof, and have been financed by the Ware house Provider and, during the pre -pricing period, \\nthe First Loss Provider.   \\nOn or prior to the Closing Date, it is expected that the Issuer will acquire all of the Warehoused Assets by \\napplying a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the Notes and  the Preferred Shares to the acquisition of the \\nWarehouse Assets for a purchase price generally equal to the respective purchase prices of the Warehoused Assets at \\nthe time they were added to the Warehouse Agreement  (as reduced by prepayments).  In addition, the Issuer will \\nreimburse the Warehouse Provider for certain costs and expenses (such amounts, together with the amount used to \\nacquire the Warehoused Assets, the “ Warehouse Termination Amount ”).  The Warehouse Termi nation Amount is \\nexpected to be approximately 98% of the net proceeds of issuance of the Notes  and the Preferred Shares . \\n \\n50 It is important to note that the terms of the purchase, or commitment to settle the purchase, of each \\nWarehoused Asset, including the purchase price paid with respect thereto, will reflect those terms that were prevailing \\nin the market at the time of the purchase of such Warehoused Asset, and such terms may not reflect the terms prevailing \\nin the market as of the Closing Date or any later  date.   In particular, as of the date of this Offering Circular, unrealized \\nlosses with respect to the Warehoused Assets are expected to be approximately  4.5% of the Effective Date Balance, \\nand no assurances can be provided to investors in the Notes or the  Preferred Shares that the purchase price paid for \\nthe Warehoused Assets will be indicative of the market value of such Warehoused Assets as of the Closing Date or \\nany later date.  Therefore, the Issuer and investors in the Notes and  the Preferred Shares w ill be assuming the risk of \\na decline in the market value and credit quality of the Warehoused Assets from the date on which the Warehoused \\nAsset was added to the portfolio until the Closing Date (and thereafter) , to the extent such losses were not realize d \\nprior to the Closing Date .  None of that risk will have been assumed by the Warehouse Provider, the Collateral \\nManager , the First Loss Provider or any other person or entity other than the Issuer and, therefore, investors in the \\nNotes  and the Preferred S hares .  It is also important to note that neither the Issuer nor investors in the Notes or the \\nPreferred Shares will be entitled to receive any payments of interest, principal or any other amounts payable or paid \\nby the obligor of any Warehoused Asset before the Closing Date.  All of such payments will have been payable or \\npaid to, and therefore benefit, only the Warehouse Provider and/or the First Loss Provider.  It is also important to note \\nthat certain indemnification obligations of the Issuer under the warehousing agreements will survive the termination \\nof those agreements on the Closing Date.  \\nThe Rating Agency may have certain conflicts of interest.  \\nThe Rating Agency  has been hired by the Issuer to provide ratings on the Notes. The Rating Agency  may \\nhave a conflict of interest because the Issuer pays the fee charged by the Rating Agency for its rating services.  \\nThe Holders of Notes may have certain conflicts of intere st. \\nCertain third parties (whether or not they become direct and/or indirect owners of Notes) that have had or \\nmay have discussions with the Collateral Manager , the Initial Purchaser s or the Placement Agent regarding the \\nPortfolio Assets may have interests  adverse to those of certain holders of Notes and may take a short position (for \\nexample, by buying protection under a credit default swap) relating to any such Portfolio Assets.  \\nCombination or “ layering ” of multiple risks may significantly increase risk o f loss . \\nAlthough the various risks discussed in this Offering Circular are generally described separately, you should \\nconsider the potential effects of the interplay of multiple risk factors. Where more than one significant risk factor is present, the risk  of loss to an investor in the Notes may be significantly increased.  ']"

The financial markets have experienced and may, in the future, experience substantial fluctuations in prices for fixed income securities and limited liquidity for such instruments. During periods of limited liquidity and higher price volatility, the Issuer ’s ability to dispose of Portfolio Assets (for which there is limited liquidity even in favorable market conditions) at a price and time that the Collateral Manager deems advantageous may be severely impair ed. Such inability may impair the Issuer ’s ability to dispose of investments in a timely fashion and for a fair price. The financial crisis and the leveraged finance markets . Among the sectors of the global credit markets that have experienced particular difficulty during the financial crisis of 2008 – 2010 were the collateralized debt obligations and leveraged finance markets. There continue to exist significant risks for the Issuer and investors should economic conditions deteriorate again, including as a result of geopolitical disruptions such as the Russian/Ukrainian conflict of 2022. These risks include, among others, (i) the likelihood that the Issuer will find it more difficult to sell any of its assets in the secondary market, thus rendering it more difficult to dispose of such assets, (ii) the possibility that, on or after the Closing Date, the price at which assets can be sold by the Issuer will have deteriorated from their effective purchase price and (iii) the illiquidity of the Notes, as there i s currently little or no secondary trading in securities issued in connection with collateral debt obligation transactions. These risks may affect the returns on the Notes to investors and the ability of investors to realize their investment in the Notes p rior to their stated maturity, if at all. In addition, obligors on Portfolio Assets may be more likely to exercise any rights they may have to redeem or refinance such Portfolio Assets when interest rates or spreads are declining. These additional risks m ay affect the returns on the Notes to investors. A slowdown in growth or commencement of a recession in the global economy, including as a result of inflationary pressures and resulting interest rate hikes, will have an adverse effect on the ability of co nsumers and businesses to repay or refinance their existing debt. Adverse macroeconomic conditions may adversely affect the rating, performance and the realization value of the Portfolio Assets. It is possible that the Portfolio Assets will experience high er default rates than anticipated and that performance will suffer. During the financial crisis, some leading global financial institutions were forced into mergers with other financial institutions, were partially or fully nationalized or became bankrupt or insolvent. There can be no assurance that similar drastic measures will not be taken as a result of future disruptions in the global credit markets.'"
